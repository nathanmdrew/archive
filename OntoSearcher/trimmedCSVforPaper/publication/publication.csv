10.1016/j.neuro.2014.08.010,The cellular and genomic response of rat dopaminergic neurons (N27) to coated nanosilver,2014,NeuroToxicology,45,,12,21,nanotoxicity; nanosilver;  capping; Surface coating; polyvinylpyrrolidone,"This study examined if nanosilver (nanoAg) of different sizes and coatings were differentially toxic to oxidative stress-sensitive neurons. N27 rat dopaminergic neurons were exposed (0.5–5 ppm) to a set of nanoAg of different sizes (10 nm, 75 nm) and coatings (PVP, citrate) and their physicochemical, cellular and genomic response measured. Both coatings retained their manufactured sizes in culture media, however, the zeta potentials of both sizes of PVP-coated nanoAg were significantly less electronegative than those of their citrate-coated counterparts. Markers of oxidative stress, measured at 0.5–5 ppm exposure concentrations, indicated that caspase 3/7 activity and glutathione levels were significantly increased by both sizes of PVP-coated nanoAg and by the 75 nm citrate-coated nanoAg. Both sizes of PVP-coated nanoAg also increased intra-neuronal nitrite levels and activated ARE/NRF2, a reporter gene for the oxidative stress-protection pathway. Global gene expression on N27 neurons, exposed to 0.5 ppm for 8 h, indicated a dominant effect by PVP-coated nanoAg over citrate. The 75 nm PVP-coated material altered 196 genes that were loosely associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. In contrast, the 10 nm PVP-coated nanoAg altered 82 genes that were strongly associated with NRF2 oxidative stress pathways. Less that 20% of the affected genes were shared by both sizes of PVP-coated nanoAg. These cellular and genomic findings suggest that PVP-coated nanoAg is more bioactive than citrate-coated nanoAg. Although both sizes of PVP-coated nanoAg altered the genomic expression of N27 neurons along oxidative stress pathways, exposure to the 75 nm nanoAg favored pathways associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, whereas the 10 nm PVP-coated nanoAg affected NRF2 neuronal protective pathways.",Brian Chorley,Bellina Veronesi,"NHEERL, USEPA"

Photosensitization by derivatized carbon nanotubes from various synthetic methods, and thus with different intrinsic characteristics (e.g., diameter and electronic properties), has been investigated under environmentally relevant aquatic conditions. We used the CNTsensitized photoisomerization of sorbic acid ((2E,4E)-hexa-2,4- dienoic acid) and singlet oxygen formation to quantify the triplet states (3CNT*) formed upon irradiation of selected single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). The CNTs used in our studies were derivatized by carboxyl groups to facilitate their dispersion in water. Results indicate that high-defect-density (thus well stabilized), small-diameter, and semiconducting-rich CNTs have higher-measured excited triplet state formation and therefore singlet oxygen (1O2) yield. Derivatized SWCNTs were significantly more photoreactive than derivatized MWCNTs. Moreover, addition of sodium chloride resulted in increased aggregation and small increases in 1O2 production of CNTs. The most photoreactive CNTs exhibited comparable photoreactivity (in terms of 3CNT* formation and 1O2 yield) to reference natural organic matter (NOM) under sunlight irradiation with the same massbased concentration. Selected reference NOM could therefore be useful in evaluating environmental photoreactivity or intended antibacterial applications of CNTs.",Chia-Ying Chen,Chia-Ying Chen,"NERL, USEPA"
10.1021/acs.est.7b01477,Simulating Multiwalled Carbobn Nanotube Transport in Surface Water Systems Using the Water Quality Analysis Simulation Program,2017,Environmental Science & Technology,51,19,11174,11184,,"Under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is required to perform new chemical reviews of nanomaterials identified in premanufacture notices. However, environmental fate models developed for traditional contaminants are limited in their ability to simulate nanomaterials’ environmental behavior by incomplete understanding and representation of the processes governing nanomaterial distribution in the environment and by scarce empirical data quantifying the interaction of nanomaterials with environmental surfaces. In this study, the well-known Water Quality Analysis Simulation Program (WASP) was updated to incorporate particle collision rate and particle attachment efficiency to simulate multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) fate and transport in surface waters. Heteroaggregation attachment efficiencies (αhet) values derived from sediment attachment studies are used to parametrize WASP for simulation of MWCNTs transport in Brier Creek, a coastal plain river located in central eastern Georgia, and a tributary to the Savannah River. Simulations using a constant MWCNT load of 0.1 kg d–1 in the uppermost Brier Creek water segment showed that MWCNTs were present predominantly in the Brier Creek water column, while downstream MWCNT surface and deep sediment concentrations exhibited a general increase with time and distance from the source, suggesting that MWCNT releases could have increasing ecological impacts in the benthic region over long time frames.",Dermont Bouchard,Dermont Bouchard,"NERL, USEPA"

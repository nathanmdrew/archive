This ban does not make sense based on conversations with multiple veterinarians. The U.S. Government does not hesitate to move people to different locations overseas to better relations with foreign governments to protect the U.S., but yet they are not trusted to bring their faithful companions with them as it is possible their pets cannot reenter the United States. What do you expect people to do spend outside of their government salary and lose security clearances based on the expenses to ship a rabies test to a random location in countries far from where they are stationed or leave their pet behind? What is the U.S. saying to other countries? We care about our people only and too bad if there is and excessive pet population left behind because the people we sent to \"assist\" you cannot afford or are not allowed to bring their pets back to the United States once they finish their tour abroad. This is a terrible political statement you are making. You are damaging relationships with countries that the U.S. spends millions of dollars to assist each year. Why not spend the money training veterinarians in these countries verses putting a ban on importing peoples' pets. Good people who are willing to serve will no longer go to these countries to help serve the United States if the U.S. Government is turning its back on people who want to help, but yet love their pets.

The rabies virus infects the central nervous system of mammals. Once symptoms start, rabies is essentially 100% fatal in all infected animals, including humans. Globally, most human deaths are attributed to canine variant rabies associated with dog bites; however, public policies like mandatory rabies vaccine requirements have eliminated canine variant rabies in the United States. The decades of work to eliminate canine variant rabies in the United States has also contributed to a steady decline of human rabies deaths nationally since the 1970’s. \n",

       "In June 2021, the Pennsylvania Department of Health (PADOH) and the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture (PDA) were notified of a dog that tested positive for canine variant rabies. Three days prior to the dog becoming ill, the dog had been part of a shipment of 33 dogs and one cat that had arrived in the US from Azerbaijan, one of the countries considered to be high-risk for canine variant rabies (https://www.cdc.gov/importation/bringing-an-animal-into-the-united-states/high-risk.html). \n",
       "\n",
       "There were nine states that were ultimately involved in the response to this case of imported canine rabies. In Pennsylvania, PADOH and PDA conducted extensive contact tracing of both the people and animals that could have been exposed to rabies from this dog. Ultimately, 14 Pennsylvania residents received rabies post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), and 10 dogs in Pennsylvania underwent post-serological monitoring (PSM) and were placed under quarantine orders. \n",
       "\n",
       "The dog had appeared healthy upon arrival and had all the necessary paperwork required for importation into the US. While previous imported cases of canine rabies were attributed to fraudulent vaccination records, this particular dog had indeed received the rabies vaccine prior to importation; unfortunately, when it was given, the vaccine was inadvertently underdosed. This meant that this dog did not receive adequate protection against rabies, which explains how it developed rabies. \n",
       "\n",
       "There had also been a delay in understanding the number and types of dogs that had been in the shipment from Azerbaijan to the United States. Requiring airlines to collect information on the importer, generate a bill of lading, and ensure that the animals will either be housed appropriately until they can be deemed healthy and rabies-free or returned to their country of origin will provide much needed safeguards to protect human and animal health. Providing a mechanism for state public health and state animal health agencies to be able to access that information from airlines in a timely manner will be vital as well.\n",
       "Additionally, this proposed rule-making update does not address cats. It is not unheard of for dogs and cats to be part of the same rescue shipment; that was certainly the case with the shipment from Azerbaijan. Extending these same requirements to cats from high-risk rabies countries would add an additional layer of protection against importation of canine-variant rabies in any species.\n",
       "\n",
       "Because Azerbaijan is high-risk, this importation would not have occurred had it taken place when the CDC’s temporary suspension of dogs entering the United States from high-risk rabies countries was in effect. This response was a significant undertaking for both agencies and required many resources, both from the people who were exposed and from the government as a whole; costs of rabies PEP can range from $1,200 to $6,500 per person, and CDC estimates that each rabid imported dog can cost the government up to $500,000 (Raybern C, Zaldivar A, Tubach S, et al. Rabies in a Dog Imported from Egypt — Kansas, 2019. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep 2020;69:1374–1377). All of those costs, however, pale in comparison to the cost of a person or pet dying from rabies.\n",
       "\n",
       "While other instances of imported rabid dogs have been attributed to fraudulent rabies vaccination certificates, it is worth noting that that was not the case here. A simple human error resulted in this dog and several others in the shipment not receiving the appropriate amount of rabies vaccine. Even if a well-intentioned and reputable organization works with a well-intentioned and reputable veterinary clinic to provide rabies vaccines, there is no way to definitively prevent human errors from happening with 100% certainty. The only thing that would have prevented this dog from putting Pennsylvania residents and animals at risk for dying from rabies would have been for the importation to not occur. The risk to public health and the cost of importing dogs from countries that are at high-risk for canine variant rabies is substantial. The Pennsylvania Department of Health and the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture are in favor of this order, support the continuation of this suspension, and look forward to working with CDC and other partners to refine these regulations in the future.</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file</td><td>3.0</td><td>1.0</td><td>CDC-2023-0051-0489</td><td>false</td><td>2023-08-18</td><td>Before</td></tr><tr><td>32</td><td>CDC-2023-0051-0490</td><td>CDC</td><td>CDC-2023-0051</td><td>llf-l68x-9woc</td><td>Public Submission</td><td>2023-08-18T04:00Z</td><td>false</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>Comment from Hayward, Michelle</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>false</td><td>CDC-2023-0051-0001</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>2023-08-17T04:00Z</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>1</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>Michelle</td><td>Hayward</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>Why has the CDC extended its ban on imported dogs until July 31st, 2024?\n",

       "After reviewing the CDC-2023-0051-0 I understand that CDC documented more than 1,000 instances of incomplete, inadequate, or fraudulent rabies vaccination certificates for dogs arriving from dog-maintained virus variant (DMRVV) high-risk countries between January 2020 and July 2021 (p. 128)1. I also understand that each affected dog may infect 26 other animals during transport and the labor hours associated with each of these cases1. However, from the CDC’s rabies records, almost all of domestic animal rabies infections are from interactions with wildlife, namely bats. Similarly, nearly all human rabies infections stem from bats as well, as CDC-2023-0051-0 reported, “... no U.S. resident has died after exposure to an imported dog with DMRVV in at least 20 years.” 1 \n",

It is easier to keep the pets at the last post in between tours, not just to limit flights, but also to limit overall change of time zone, climate, environment, and living conditions. Furthermore, it is difficult enough to transport animals from overseas following the federal procurement requirements, adding a requirement that limits airports to 20 locations may increase travel time for the pet and costs for the owners that are not reimbursable.  \n",

       "I understand the need to minimize the chances for reintroduction of rabies into the US population of dogs. However, the proposed change would have a significant impact on the dog fancy community. Members of the dog fancy community are involved the importation of puppies into the US from select litters of particular interest to them based on the genetics of the dog for sport of conformation events. These people typically import 1 or 2 puppies at a time and get them into homes that will see that they are raised well and prepared for their future activities. These puppies are rarely found to be rabid. \n",

       "Conversely, based on published reports, it seems that the importation of rabid animals occurs far more frequently in larger-scale importation activities, usually conducted by organizations involved in the retail rescue industry.

It took 4 years to have this many. This is a significant issue. The current “Option B” ability for a personal pet owner to bring 1-2 dogs from a high-risk country through 18 airports with a CDC Dog Import Permit does not appear in the current FRN. Is Option B going to continue or be eliminated for personal pet owners? Are all foreign–vaccinated dogs from high risk countries going to be funneled through only 5 airports? To serve citizens across the country, including foreign service and military, CDC must open a solicitation to at least double the number of animal care facilities with better geographic distribution to avoid bottle necks and near-monopolies. Already some of these facilities command fees that are exorbitant for the required pick up, a USDA veterinarian exam and a rabies vaccination (as much as $1,600 per dog). In addition to titer test at $200-$300, airline crate at $100-$200, excess baggage fee of $500 to $750, this can push dog import costs well over $2,500 per dog which is a significant burden.\n",

       "RE: more signatures on RVMR. The current Rabies Vaccination and Microchip Record should continue as is, without the proposed vague requirement for an additional “certification” by a “government official”. This puts too much burden on pet owners to jump through unnecessary hoops. The RVMR is vouched for by the importer (whose contact information is provided) and by the licensed veterinarian (whose contact information is provided) and also by the required rabies titer which is from a CDC-approved lab and is certified by yet another veterinarian. The current requirements for RVMR plus titer should stand as-is without additional onerous and vague requirements as together these documents and certifying individuals ensure that the dog is not only properly vaccinated against rabies but has also demonstrated immune response. The CDC could take other more-targeted measures should issues arise in future such as maintaining a list of veterinarians who are ineligible to sign the RVMR for US import for a specified period. This more-targeted action will better ensure compliance by subjecting foreign veterinarians to losing customers should they lose the ability to sign a document for US import. For dogs who arrive without a rabies titer there is already the requirement for rabies re-vaccination plus a 28-day quarantine which obviates rabies risk (at a cost of $4,265 at the Ark at JFK for example). \n",
       "\n",
       "RE:  DVMRR-restricted countries. Again, why not utilize a more-targeted effort and create a list of specific foreign veterinarians who due to past problems are prohibited from signing off on US import paperwork? If a violation occurs (ie a fraudulent rabies certificate) then the issuing veterinarian as well as the importer can be notified (because the form already captures phone and email) and a list posted on the CDC website of veterinarians by country who have lost priviledges of issuing an RVMR. Utilizing economic forces would seem to be more efficient at eliminating fraud from this system. \n",

We lived in Washington DC for four years and then traveled to South Africa in late 2019 and stayed there for three years with all of their vaccinations up to date.  We went through the CDC permit process to return from South Africa to the United States in July 2022.  We then left for India in September 2022.  My dogs will return to the United States permanently in November of this year.

It would be helpful if at least the same time deadlines (waiting three months for the titer etc) were not imposed each trip.  Also would be helpful if, once we have completed a permit request, we would simply need to update the request with proof of current vaccinations etc.\n",

I do feel it is important that in certain situations, dogs who live in the US should be allowed health exemptions with a letter from their veterinarian. All vaccines carry risks and very small, tea cup breeds have the very highest incidences of reactions. In addition to the health implications for a dog that has had reactions to a rabies vaccine, the risk of a very small / tea-cup dog contracting rabies while traveling is extremely low. A consideration for dogs who need to travel out of the US and home but need modifications to the requirements for health reasons should be given the option of a medical professional's letter of exemption. Health certificates and examinations prior to entering the US are prudent and would make sense for all dogs regardless of vaccination status. These exam requirements could take place multiple times, as in a few days before travel and then again on travel day in order to rule out illness or rabies infection entirely.

As things stand, a growing number of U.S. flag airlines will not transport dogs in hold; the proposed change would only make this harder.  The import restrictions introduced in 2019 led many airlines to refuse to transport dogs into the U.S. - which nearly led to our U.S.-vaccinated dog being left behind when our family was ordered to evacuate Ethiopia in 2021.

When we tried to bring the same dog home from Ethiopia in 2021, Turkish Airlines refused to transport him or any other dogs out of Addis Ababa if the final destination was the U.S., because of concerns about the rabies import restrictions.

Logically, if foreign vaccine certificates aren’t going to be considered valid, regardless of endorsements or any other authentications, then there is no point whatsoever in requiring people to supply them for review by CDC/USDA/CBP. The odds of an animal with an acceptable titer result carrying rabies is roughly zero. If foreign vaccinations are so unacceptable, then just disregard them, require the titer, and re-vaccinate on arrival.

Puppies, being imported to the US, one or two puppies at a time, who themselves have been raised with care in the homes of small breeders abroad are not the same situation as unknown, \"puppy mill\" and \"rescued\" street dogs/pariah dogs found internationally. Although the risk of disease through these unknown dogs is legitimate, it is entirely a separate circumstance from individual dogs whose health and pedigree are known to both the exporting party and the importing party. These new rules, if passed as they are, will require Americans looking to import dogs into their breeding program to pay the exporter for an additional three to four months of care for the puppy, miss out on valuable training and bonding time with the dog, and place those burdens on the exporting family. In turn, depending on the size of the dog, the importing process under the belly of the plane places undue stress on a still-young animal. That is, of course, if the exporting party lets the dog leave their country of origin at all: six months raising & loving & training a dog only to send them thousands of miles away is a tall ask, nevermind the burden of raising the dog for that long, when the dog could simply be sold domestically. All of these concerns, human though they may be, are just the immediate concerns that come to mind when faced with this potential reality. Long-term, in rare and emerging breeds within the United States (those breeds participating in AKC's Foundation Stock Service & Misc. Class, as well as rarer breeds who have full recognition), we will see a depletion of quality & the lack of access to \"new lines\" will prevent the population from safely growing within the US. The risks of freezing & collecting semen and importing are significant, as there is never a guarantee of pregnancy, and often the best decision we may make for our smaller breeding programs is the import of a puppy, and place our hopes on that dog's health and conformation maturing into what we hope for. There simply must be a way to establish a international health certificate in Europe based on the parents known vaccine status, the presence of disease within a country, and further the health assessment on the young dog(s) in question-- that will decrease the risk of disease, increase the standard that imported, rescued dogs are held to, and allow dogs to enter into this country without the importing party missing out on critical socialization time with their young dogs. These dogs may be bred, eventually, following breed specific health testing, but they are all ultimately pets who are quite loved, and these rules stand to benefit very few, if any, people or animals in particular and likely will have lasting negative implications on both rescue dog populations and those importing known, well-bred dogs of good pedigree & health</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file</td><td>0.0</td><td>1.0</td><td>CDC-2023-0051-0557</td><td>false</td><td>2023-08-28</td><td>After</td></tr><tr><td>100</td><td>CDC-2023-0051-0558</td><td>CDC</td><td>CDC-2023-0051</td><td>llu-gobl-rzey</td><td>Public Submission</td><td>2023-08-29T04:00Z</td><td>false</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>Comment from Villarroel , Lindsey </td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>false</td><td>CDC-2023-0051-0001</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>2023-08-28T04:00Z</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>1</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>Lindsey</td><td>Villarroel</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>Please exempt the US military and State Departments members who are serving the country overseas.

       " Because we love our animals dearly, we have been diligent and meticulous about ensuring that they are always current on ALL of their vaccinations and see that they have have regular health care screenings. Over the years, we have come to know many, many other American families serving overseas, whether with the Department of State, the U.S. Armed Forces, or another government agency, and have observed nothing less than the same level of commitment toward ensuring that their pets are always well cared for and current on their vaccinations.\n",

       "Anyone who has moved overseas with a beloved pet knows all too well the many metaphorical hoops we already need to jump through, which are extremely time intensive and costly, in order to ensure that we have the appropriate health care certifications and documentation in order to enter the countries to which we travel and also back to the U.S. upon our return. I fully support ensuring that our animals are protected against rabies and providing documentation to demonstrate that; however, the additional restrictions imposed upon government personnel and their families in order to move their pets back to the U.S. from the high-risk rabies countries add untold hardship and stress during the already very stressful process of relocating from a foreign country. I have personally witnessed many families scramble - even with advanced planning and preparation - to complete all of the currently necessary steps to ensure that they can re-enter the U.S. with their dogs, adding an additional layer of stress and anxiety to their PCS (permanent change of station) moves.\n",

       "Personally, my family very narrowly missed having to figure out how to bring our dog safely home from Ethiopia in 2021, when we had to evacuate due to civil unrest.   We were given only a day or two to pack up our belongings and complete all of the necessary steps required for a transition back to the U.S. from a diplomatic mission. Had the CDC’s dog importation suspension been in place at the time that we had to leave, we would have faced an impossible situation and the very real and heartbreaking prospect of having to leave our beloved pets behind. The thought of this makes me sick to my stomach... especially considering that we had just served nearly three years in a hostile country during the worst of the Covid pandemic. On many days, it was the comfort of our pets that got us through those challenging times.\n",
       "I respectfully ask that the CDC please consider very carefully the many negative effects that these proposed regulations will have on tens of thousands of government  personnel and their families who are serving the country overseas. While yes, we have chosen our careers and lifestyles of constant relocation, this does not mean that it is easy. We serve our country proudly and our pets provide an indescribable level of comfort and support while we are away from our families and friends back home. If these new regulations absolutely must go into effect, I propose an exemption for government personnel serving overseas in countries that are considered high risk for rabies. As mentioned above, I can understand and support requiring us to provide documentation of rabies vaccination, as has always been the case, but to add all of the additional layers of red tape in order simply to bring our furry family members home from the often challenging locations where we are serving on behalf the U.S. causes an enormous amount of stress and hardship during the already very difficult process of relocating internationally.\n",

This rule imposes undue difficulties on servicemembers and public servants, such as Department of State Foreign Service personnel, who are already assuming tremendous security, financial, and personal hardships to move their families abroad in support of U.S. national interests.  The HHS rule appears to be focused on “incomplete or fraudulent rabies vaccination certificates” and “criminal networks involved in the lucrative dog trade”.  Neither of these categories apply to public servants and military members.  These U.S. citizens understand the importance of full compliance with U.S. rules and regulations, particularly as they impact public health in the United States.  The majority of the dogs and cats traveling with these U.S. citizens were born in the United States and cared for by U.S. vets.  Those adopted by families overseas receive extensive treatment by foreign vets, in compliance with U.S. best practices for animal care.  By imposing such harsh restrictions on U.S. public servants and military personnel, the CDC is discounting the trust that the U.S. government already places in such personnel to best represent the interests of the United States, including the duty to keep the U.S. homeland safe from public health threats.  It is the height of irony that the U.S. government would spend hundreds of thousands of dollars vetting military servicemembers and public servants for high security clearances, only to turn around and say that they cannot be trusted to ensure their pets are properly vaccinated.  By forcing U.S. servicemembers and public servants to follow the proposed rules, HHS will be forcing these families to incur significant financial hardships and additional stress in altering travel arrangements under the guise of addressing a threat that simply does not exist among this demographic of traveler.  Families who cannot afford to shoulder this burden will be faced with the unthinkable decision of having to re-home pets that have become members of their family.  If we are asking servicemembers and public servants to assume risks by taking hardships assignments outside the United States, we must trust them to comply with existing U.S. regulations.  If this act is to go forward, it simply must have an exemption built in for personnel overseas on official U.S. government orders.\n",

I appreciate the opportunity to comment on CDC’s proposed rulemaking regarding the import of dogs and cats into the United States. The impetus of this law resulted from numerous cases of fraudulent import paperwork and the importation of dogs with rabies. The intent of this law is to prevent additional occurrences and protect public health by preventing the reintroduction and spread of dog-maintained rabies virus variant (DMRVV) in the United States. I understand the intent of the law and the concern for public health however I ask the CDC to consider and mitigate the unintended consequences of this proposed rule. As it stands, this proposed rule is detrimental to US government employees serving their country abroad who navigate the complicated animal health requirements of many countries as they move their companion animals with them. \n",
       "\n",
       "As I read the executive summary of the rule, I see ‘importation’ again and again. The CDC needs to better define what conditions they are considering when they are  talking about ‘importation’ and what activity they are trying to regulate. When US government personnel return to the US after being posted abroad, we are not ‘importing’ our dogs or cats. We are returning to the US with our family and our pets generally for a short period of time before we are sent to our next post. During this time, we seek the medical care we could not receive overseas, we attend to the needs of family that remained in the US, we take care of personnel and financial matters, and we receive training to prepare us for our next post. Categorizing our pets as imports, requiring them to enter only through certain ports, and mandating a quarantine period puts an undue burden on a group of public servants who already get enough of that with these emotionally, mentally, and physically demanding careers we have chosen for the public good. \n",
       "We follow the rules of animal transport, vaccination, and animal health all because we want the best for our pets and we want them to be able to move with us and will not risk their loss. We pose little threat to the DMRVV-free status of the US and are unlikely to be associated with fraudulent paperwork. I ask that the CDC grant an exception to the requirements in this proposed rule, either through the definition of import, acknowledgement of government and military personnel in the rule, or in some other manner. Moving away from a country of origin focused rule to an end use focused rule (sale/adoption versus companion animal) should also be considered. \n",
       "\n",
       "I understand that the CDC makes decisions in the interest of protecting public health and hope the CDC works to understand the situation of US government personnel and their companion animals, and reconsiders the extent and applicability of the proposed rule and makes an exception for US Government personnel. The CDC is basically exiling me from returning to the US until my dogs dies, so thanks for that. \n",
       "HHS/CDC also proposes to prohibit or otherwise restrict importation of dogs into the United States from certain countries that have a history of exporting dogs infected with DMRVV to other countries or have demonstrated a lack of appropriate veterinary controls to prevent the exportation of rabid dogs: An exception for US government personnel should be added here. We have no control over where we are posted and should not pay the price because we are serving our country abroad with our family which incudes our companion animals. It also doesn’t help that CDC has designated most countries as DMRVV high risk countries. \n",
       "Prior to traveling out of the United States, a USDA-Accredited Veterinarian would need to complete and sign a form titled “ Certification of U.S.-issued Rabies Vaccination for Live Dog Re-entry into the United States.” - Does this form exist – have you coordinated with USDA VS to create this form? What is your educational campaign to provide it to all of the accredited vets and make sure vet clinics know they need this? Also, what are you going to do for people like me who are already overseas? What if I don’t return for 5 more years? You are complicating an already complicating process by requiring yet another form. And expecting people to hold on to the form for the 2-4 years they are at post. Or even longer if we don’t come home between posts. \n",

In addition to duplicative requirements which seem to serve little purpose (for example, verification of the vaccination by titer test and re-vaccination even once the first vaccination has been verified) the lack of flexibility with which it has been implemented is remarkable.  The CDC has shown inflexibility at every step of the way, refusing to make things simpler for military and foreign service members who own pets and also not following the letter of their own rules.  Last time I returned to the US with a dog, I received an authorization which stated it was valid at any of the approved ports of entry.

She arrived in the US fully vetted and my local vet did a full work up on her at her first appointment. These dogs don’t represent a problem to the level that these restrictions cover.

         "The proposed rule places unnecessary burden on dog owners living overseas. As a public health professional, I understand the importance of preventing the reintroduction of rabies to America, but as a US Diplomat, I am dismayed that CDC has established rules that are excessively onerous. \n\nAs a USAID Foreign Service Officer, most, if not all, countries that I may be assigned are on CDC's list of high risk countries, and do not have Approved Rabies Serology Laboratories. As a single woman, my dogs provide both companionship and security when living overseas in difficult places. While I will not bid on positions in countries where pets are not permitted, I am deeply concerned about these rules in the event of an unanticipated emergency leading to ordered departure from a post. This could be for a number of reasons from political instability, to an environmental emergency, with very little warning. In the event of an ordered departure, there would not be time (or possibly even in country systems) to obtain a serology test from abroad and get CDC importation approval (the recommended time according to CDC is 8 weeks). Abandoning my dogs or putting my dogs in a 28 day quarantine would be an additional burden in an already difficult time.\n\nAs a responsible dog owner, I ensure that my dog is up to date on all vaccines. While I understand that these rules are intended to prevent falsified documentation, I urge you to consider an exception for USG employees and service members serving abroad, or at a minimum exceptions for people serving at posts on ordered departure. \n\nI make sacrifices to serve my country in difficult posts overseas, and I accept a certain level of risk to do so, but I also expect my country to take care of my family unit, which includes my dogs ",

There are thousands of individuals that work for the U.S. Government, contractors for the government, and family members who are trusted to go work in locations outside of the U.S. to assist, protect and serve U.S. citizens while giving up the conveniences of the U.S. Yet, you are going to put a ban or charge money to officials and employees of the United States who make the sacrifice to serve their country. This ban does not make sense based on conversations with multiple veterinarians. The U.S. Government does not hesitate to move people to different locations overseas to better relations with foreign governments to protect the U.S., but yet they are not trusted to bring their faithful companions with them as it is possible their pets cannot reenter the United States. What do you expect people to do spend outside of their government salary and lose security clearances based on the expenses to ship a rabies test to a random location in countries far from where they are stationed or leave their pet behind? What is the U.S. saying to other countries? We care about our people only and too bad if there is and excessive pet population left behind because the people we sent to \"assist\" you cannot afford or are not allowed to bring their pets back to the United States once they finish their tour abroad. This is a terrible political statement you are making. You are damaging relationships with countries that the U.S. spends millions of dollars to assist each year. Why not spend the money training veterinarians in these countries verses putting a ban on importing peoples' pets. Good people who are willing to serve will no longer go to these countries to help serve the United States if the U.S. Government is turning its back on people who want to help, but yet love their pets. This proposed rule is a terrible decision by the CDC.",

The number of cases of communicable diseases being imported into a country is not such a large number as to consign so many countless humane, merciful cases to defeat or very often, death.

         "If such restrictions are implemented, they would have several potential implications for U.S. diplomats and their pets, similar to the U.S. military:\n\nImpact on morale, recruitment, and U.S. National Security: The U.S. government and foreign service agencies need skilled diplomats to represent the U.S. abroad. Policies that make it difficult for diplomats to bring their pets back home will affect morale and deter prospective diplomats from accepting overseas assignments, which in turn risks U.S. national security.\n\nHealth concerns are not mitigated by restricting U.S. diplomats' pets: U.S. diplomats' pets are always vaccinated against rabies and other diseases. While vaccinations are essential for public health and the safety of both humans and animals, import restrictions are unnecessary because diplomat's pets have vaccinations and pose minimal risk of disease transmission.\n\nEmotional stress: Diplomats and their families often experience significant emotional stress during overseas postings. Pets can provide valuable companionship and support during these challenging times. Forcing diplomats to leave their beloved pets behind due to import restrictions could add further emotional strain and make the transition back to the United States more difficult.\n\nLong separation periods: If import restrictions are in place, diplomats have to explore other options for rehoming their pets or temporarily leaving them in the host country. This could lead to extended periods of separation from their pets, which can be distressing for both the diplomats and the animals at significant personal cost.\n\nLimited options for bringing pets: U.S. diplomats often live in various countries around the world, and their assignments can last for several years. During their time abroad, diplomats maintain strong bonds with their pets and plan to bring them back to the United States when their assignment ends. If import restrictions are imposed, diplomats will find it more difficult to bring their pets home.\n\nI strongly encourage the CDC to consider the negative impact restrictions for U.S. diplomats would have on U.S. national security without improving public safety. Please, please make it easier for our diplomats to bring their pets back to the United States after serving the country overseas.",

         "Rabies is a preventable viral disease most often transmitted through the bite of a rabid animal. The rabies virus infects the central nervous system of mammals. Once symptoms start, rabies is essentially 100% fatal in all infected animals, including humans. Globally, most human deaths are attributed to canine variant rabies associated with dog bites; however, public policies like mandatory rabies vaccine requirements have eliminated canine variant rabies in the United States. The decades of work to eliminate canine variant rabies in the United States has also contributed to a steady decline of human rabies deaths nationally since the 1970’s. \n\nIn June 2021, the Pennsylvania Department of Health (PADOH) and the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture (PDA) were notified of a dog that tested positive for canine variant rabies. Three days prior to the dog becoming ill, the dog had been part of a shipment of 33 dogs and one cat that had arrived in the US from Azerbaijan, one of the countries considered to be high-risk for canine variant rabies (https://www.cdc.gov/importation/bringing-an-animal-into-the-united-states/high-risk.html). \n\nThere were nine states that were ultimately involved in the response to this case of imported canine rabies. In Pennsylvania, PADOH and PDA conducted extensive contact tracing of both the people and animals that could have been exposed to rabies from this dog. Ultimately, 14 Pennsylvania residents received rabies post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), and 10 dogs in Pennsylvania underwent post-serological monitoring (PSM) and were placed under quarantine orders. \n\nThe dog had appeared healthy upon arrival and had all the necessary paperwork required for importation into the US. While previous imported cases of canine rabies were attributed to fraudulent vaccination records, this particular dog had indeed received the rabies vaccine prior to importation; unfortunately, when it was given, the vaccine was inadvertently underdosed. This meant that this dog did not receive adequate protection against rabies, which explains how it developed rabies. \n\nThere had also been a delay in understanding the number and types of dogs that had been in the shipment from Azerbaijan to the United States. Requiring airlines to collect information on the importer, generate a bill of lading, and ensure that the animals will either be housed appropriately until they can be deemed healthy and rabies-free or returned to their country of origin will provide much needed safeguards to protect human and animal health. Providing a mechanism for state public health and state animal health agencies to be able to access that information from airlines in a timely manner will be vital as well.\nAdditionally, this proposed rule-making update does not address cats. It is not unheard of for dogs and cats to be part of the same rescue shipment; that was certainly the case with the shipment from Azerbaijan. Extending these same requirements to cats from high-risk rabies countries would add an additional layer of protection against importation of canine-variant rabies in any species.\n\nBecause Azerbaijan is high-risk, this importation would not have occurred had it taken place when the CDC’s temporary suspension of dogs entering the United States from high-risk rabies countries was in effect. This response was a significant undertaking for both agencies and required many resources, both from the people who were exposed and from the government as a whole; costs of rabies PEP can range from $1,200 to $6,500 per person, and CDC estimates that each rabid imported dog can cost the government up to $500,000 (Raybern C, Zaldivar A, Tubach S, et al. Rabies in a Dog Imported from Egypt — Kansas, 2019. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep 2020;69:1374–1377). All of those costs, however, pale in comparison to the cost of a person or pet dying from rabies.\n\nWhile other instances of imported rabid dogs have been attributed to fraudulent rabies vaccination certificates, it is worth noting that that was not the case here. A simple human error resulted in this dog and several others in the shipment not receiving the appropriate amount of rabies vaccine. Even if a well-intentioned and reputable organization works with a well-intentioned and reputable veterinary clinic to provide rabies vaccines, there is no way to definitively prevent human errors from happening with 100% certainty. The only thing that would have prevented this dog from putting Pennsylvania residents and animals at risk for dying from rabies would have been for the importation to not occur. The risk to public health and the cost of importing dogs from countries that are at high-risk for canine variant rabies is substantial. The Pennsylvania Department of Health and the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture are in favor of this order, support the continuation of this suspension, and look forward to working with CDC and other partners to refine these regulations in the future.",

         "Why has the CDC extended its ban on imported dogs until July 31st, 2024?\n\nAnother year of dogs stuck; unable to move on from reliable, responsible rescues who care for and vaccinate their dogs and want to see them happily settled in US homes.\n\nI can understand denying entry to those dogs that are unvaccinated and undocumented, but if they have all their paperwork and shots, they should not be denied entry.\n\nThis ban is causing an unbearable strain on overcrowded rescues in some of the poorest countries in the world. To get them ready for adoption takes a huge amount of resources, determination, and altruism to achieve. \nAnd yet it has been successfully achieved for years by thousands of rescue organizations and individuals! \n\nBecause of the ban, puppies are growing into adults in conditions that are not good for behavior, making them harder to retrain the longer they wait in limbo - and less attractive to potential adopters who often want puppies. \n\nThe costs of keeping dogs longer is also crippling these people as food and medical costs keep rising. We supporters can only donate so much! A space taken in a rescue for longer than necessary, is a safe space unavailable to other dogs enduring hardship, starvation, and cruelty on the streets.\n\nAdd to this the immense distress caused to people trying to move to the US with their personal dogs - including veterans - combined with a lack of CDC-approved labs, and the ban is unjustifiable.\n\nThe CDC should be more concerned about the terrible conditions within US factory farms, fur farms, and puppy mills that are virtually unregulated. They are far more likely to carry disease than vaccinated dogs sent by caring people from other countries. \n\nThe UK had a similar ban on dog imports for the same reasons as the CDC, lasting just 9 months. There is no reason for this ban to drag on another year.\n\nA blanket ban on one beloved species is not disease control. It is discrimination. We are not all puppy farmers and illegal importers.\n\nTo make it permanent would be unconscionable.\n\nPlease address what needs changing to make the system work, and let's keep saving lives. \n\n",

         "I appreciate the spirit of the proposed rule, however the manner in which it greatly affects U.S. government servants representing the interests of the United States abroad makes this blanket rule untenable. \n\nFor Foreign Service Officers and other federally employed staff working for U.S. government agencies abroad, this rule has dire consequences on the morale and quality of life for many officers. We are acutely aware and familiar with the importance of implementing U.S. Government rules and laws abroad. We frequently have high-level security clearances, granted on this basis of our integrity and honesty. \n\nThe data presented in the rule is not nuanced enough. This rule fails to account for or reference data regarding any U.S. Government employees' dogs that may have violated the USG's rules about valid rabies vaccinations. Therefore, given the strict rules and regulations USG employees are required to follow in all other aspects of their personal and professional lives while employed by the USG and residing abroad, I humbly request the CDC consider a waiver directly for employees of the U.S. Government. \n\nAnimals, especially dogs, are a vital part of our lives while abroad. They often provide comfort and familiarity for families when everything else in our lives frequently and rapidly changes (including changes that are not always in our control, such as being evacuated in the event of an emergency from a country). Rather than impose a blanket ban on the importation of all dogs from abroad, there has to be a better way to achieve this rule while recognizing the hardship this rule places on U.S. Government employees working abroad. \n\nRecognizing that the CDC does permit for import on the basis of titer tests is helpful, however the availability of said titer tests is often hard and unreliable abroad. Considering an exemption for U.S. Government employees who have documented proof of consistent rabies vaccines would be a much better option. Leaving our pets behind in a country, or not being able to bring them with us to a new assignment (as was the case with my dog) severely affects employee morale and creates a void in families that cannot be filled. I take my position representing the United States abroad extremely seriously. It is in the oath of office we sign when we first join the Foreign Service to \"protect and defend\" the United States. That includes against diseases such as rabies. The last thing any one of us wants to do is bring a potentially deadly virus into the U.S. That being said, I urge the CDC to consider a waiver for dogs imported by U.S. families, not just in rabies-free countries, but from all countries with documented proof of a rabies vaccine. Upon arrival to the U.S. it is much easier and feasible to get a titer test. If one is still required, perhaps and option would be to permit for the titer test to be performed in the U.S. within so many days of arrival and importation. ",

It was very stressful trying to make sure our dog had all the correct vaccinations and documentation before we left the U.S. last year (during what is already a very stressful transition time for the family), to ensure that we would have a smooth re-entry back into the U.S. in 2 years. Now, this NPRM is going to make it even more cumbersome for families with pets who are assigned to work abroad. I'm particularly opposed to requirement 7 which requires the family to have certified the rabies vaccination form titled \"Certification of U.S.-Issued Rabies Vaccination for Live Dog Re-Entry into the United States BEFORE the dog departed the U.S. This requirement is not fair to families who are already departed the U.S. with their dog before this rule was proposed.

It is already costly to import a puppy for sport or other purposes; this ruling will make it very substantially harder because very few foreign breeders would be willing to keep a puppy for 6 months, and if they are, the level of socialization they will provide is likely to be substantially less than a dedicated owner.  If imports are restricted, especially for dogs like Belgian shepherds/malinois, genetic bottlenecks and greater inbreeding will make these breeds more disease-prone — and we, including the USG, need our purpose-bred dogs to be healthy.\nWould it be possible to amend the proposed regulation to allow INDIVIDUALS only to import up to 2 dogs a year under age 6 months from rabies-free countries? \nThat would require a pre approval process but would meet most legitimate breeder/hobbyist/sport or other need.

         "The Drentsche Patrijshond Club of North America (DPCNA) is a Montana non-profit corporation dedicated to maintaining the Drentsche Patrijshond (Drent) as a field ready and family oriented versatile pointing dog in North America as the breed is kept in its homeland, the Netherlands.\n\nThe DPCNA opposes – in part - the proposed rulemaking as it would introduce an unduly restrictive importation process, detrimental for our breed, that fails to serve a demonstrated public health purpose. Drents are imported from European countries that have eradicated rabies: Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark and Sweden. The CDC neither requires nor proposes a rabies vaccination requirement for dogs coming from these countries. Nonetheless, the proposed rule-making would needlessly apply an age restriction, expressly tied to the need to verify rabies vaccination, to the importation of puppies from countries without a rabies vaccination requirement.\n\nThe DPCNA proposes that the exception to the age requirement provided to arrivals from Canada and Mexico should be extended on equal terms to other low-risk or DMRVV-free countries, which would also necessitate striking the land crossing requirement. This modest solution fully addresses the public health concerns outlined in the notice of proposed rulemaking. The solution has the added benefit of making the proposed rule internally consistent.\nThere is no commercial importation of Drents: United States citizens import individual Drent puppies based on a personal relationship with a European breeder. Drent puppies mostly come from the Netherlands, but also Belgium, Denmark and Sweden. Each of these countries is not only free of canine rabies, but – unlike the United States – completely rabies free.1 Documentation accompanying puppies establishes their age and vaccination status as well as ownership by the citizen returning home with the puppy. Traveling at eight weeks of age, consistent with USDA requirements, a puppy travels in the passenger cabin with its owner and not as unattended cargo.\n\nUnless modified, the proposed rule would create insurmountable and unnecessary barriers to the success of the Drent in the United States. The Drent is a rare breed. The North American population is small and largely comprised of dogs imported as puppies and the immediate offspring of these dogs. Genetic diversity is limited in the current population. The breed in North America will not thrive and may not survive without the infusion of diverse genetics through the further importation of Drent puppies from rabies-free countries.\n\nThere is no public health justification for applying the proposed six-month age requirement to puppies coming from rabies-free countries. The age requirement is an overbroad, inconsistently applied, and misguided animal welfare provision, at least where older dogs may enter the United States without proof of rabies vaccination. The age provision may have merit for dogs coming from high-risk countries where CDC requires vaccination for rabies that is not possible in young puppies. But it has no applicability where no vaccination requirement currently exists or is proposed.\n\nProposed Solution: The exception to the age requirement provided to arrivals from Canada and Mexico should be extended on equal terms to other low-risk or DMRVV-free countries, which would also necessitate striking the land crossing requirement.",

         "Public Comment on CDC’s Dog and Cat Importation Regulation (42 CFR 71.50 and 71.51) Docket Number (CDC-2023-0051) or the RIN (0920-AA82) \n\nAfter reviewing the CDC-2023-0051-0 I understand that CDC documented more than 1,000 instances of incomplete, inadequate, or fraudulent rabies vaccination certificates for dogs arriving from dog-maintained virus variant (DMRVV) high-risk countries between January 2020 and July 2021 (p. 128)1. I also understand that each affected dog may infect 26 other animals during transport and the labor hours associated with each of these cases1. However, from the CDC’s rabies records, almost all of domestic animal rabies infections are from interactions with wildlife, namely bats. Similarly, nearly all human rabies infections stem from bats as well, as CDC-2023-0051-0 reported, “... no U.S. resident has died after exposure to an imported dog with DMRVV in at least 20 years.” 1 \n\nRegarding the domestic animals infected with rabies, outdoor pets and strays are most likely the problem.2 The number of strays and domestic pets with rabies correlate by state. For instance, Texas led in both number of euthanized domestic animals (which due to lack of required reporting, one can assume represents strays or abandoned animals) and rabies infected dogs in 2018.2,3   \n\nIt is infeasible to transport dogs internationally for American vaccines issued by American vets. Not all military and Foreign Service posts have American vets. The current rule does not accept rabies vaccines from other sources, but returning pets to the US in between overseas tours increases trauma and stress to the pets and the owners. It is easier to keep the pets at the last post in between tours, not just to limit flights, but also to limit overall change of time zone, climate, environment, and living conditions. Furthermore, it is difficult enough to transport animals from overseas following the federal procurement requirements, adding a requirement that limits airports to 20 locations may increase travel time for the pet and costs for the owners that are not reimbursable.  \n\nCDC should focus on responsible animal breeding, ownership (proper vaccination and no “unattended”/”outdoor” pets), stray/adoption reporting, and import of newly acquired international animal requirements rather than punishing Foreign and Military Service members who take their furry family members with them from the US. Finally, based on the numbers, Texas is more of a problem than international imports.  \n\nResources: \n\n1 CDC’s Dog and Cat Importation Regulation (42 CFR 71.50 and 71.51) Docket Number (CDC-2023-0051) or the RIN (0920-AA82) available at: https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/07/10/2023-14343/control-of-communicable-diseases-foreign-quarantine-importation-of-dogs-and-cats \n\n2 CDC 2018.

         "To Whom It May Concern:\n\nI understand the need to minimize the chances for reintroduction of rabies into the US population of dogs. However, the proposed change would have a significant impact on the dog fancy community. Members of the dog fancy community are involved the importation of puppies into the US from select litters of particular interest to them based on the genetics of the dog for sport of conformation events. These people typically import 1 or 2 puppies at a time and get them into homes that will see that they are raised well and prepared for their future activities. These puppies are rarely found to be rabid. \n\nConversely, based on published reports, it seems that the importation of rabid animals occurs far more frequently in larger-scale importation activities, usually conducted by organizations involved in the retail rescue industry. They bring in larger numbers of dogs from poor situations in an effort to rescue and rehome the dogs. While their objectives may be admirable, their ability to screen appropriate animals seems to be poor. \n\nIt seems that a more refined approach could better serve the dog community, as a whole. It would seem to make sense to institute any of the below:\n1. Allow the importation of no more than 2-5 animals of all ages from a single shipper on any flight\n2. Allow the importation of no more than 2-5 animals of age 10 weeks to 6 months on any flight\n3. Allow individual owners/organization to import no more than 2-5 animals of age 10 weeks to 6 months in any 1-year period\n\nI believe that that a more nuanced approach provides a better solution for all dog owners, both those importing dogs as well as those in the US who will never import a dog and want to make sure that rabies is NOT reintroduced into the US dog population.",

         "RE:  new requirement for all dogs to be microchipped. This is a positive, common sense and relatively inexpensive means of ensuring that dogs have a unique identifier and helps to ensure that veterinary documents match the dog imported. Yes, let’s do this! \n\nRE:  new required form is proposed. The FRN references the “CDC Import Submission Form” - yet the form is not available for review. This new form will have broad and sweeping application (“This proposed requirement would apply to all imported dogs (including dogs arriving from DMRVV-free and DMRVV low-risk countries) arriving in the United States by air, land, or sea.”) It is imperative to share the contents of this form since it would apply to all dogs and all importers. New rule making should not proceed until this form is made public. \n\nRE: arrival ports. \"For dogs that have been in a DMRVV high-risk country in the past six months, and were vaccinated in a foreign country, this NPRM proposes that the dog be required to arrive a U.S. airport with a CDC quarantine station and a CDC-registered Animal Care Facility.\" Only 5 airports in the entire United States currently have a CDC Animal Care Facility. It took 4 years to have this many. This is a significant issue. The current “Option B” ability for a personal pet owner to bring 1-2 dogs from a high-risk country through 18 airports with a CDC Dog Import Permit does not appear in the current FRN. Is Option B going to continue or be eliminated for personal pet owners? Are all foreign–vaccinated dogs from high risk countries going to be funneled through only 5 airports? To serve citizens across the country, including foreign service and military, CDC must open a solicitation to at least double the number of animal care facilities with better geographic distribution to avoid bottle necks and near-monopolies. Already some of these facilities command fees that are exorbitant for the required pick up, a USDA veterinarian exam and a rabies vaccination (as much as $1,600 per dog). In addition to titer test at $200-$300, airline crate at $100-$200, excess baggage fee of $500 to $750, this can push dog import costs well over $2,500 per dog which is a significant burden.\n\nRE: more signatures on RVMR. The current Rabies Vaccination and Microchip Record should continue as is, without the proposed vague requirement for an additional “certification” by a “government official”. This puts too much burden on pet owners to jump through unnecessary hoops. The RVMR is vouched for by the importer (whose contact information is provided) and by the licensed veterinarian (whose contact information is provided) and also by the required rabies titer which is from a CDC-approved lab and is certified by yet another veterinarian. The current requirements for RVMR plus titer should stand as-is without additional onerous and vague requirements as together these documents and certifying individuals ensure that the dog is not only properly vaccinated against rabies but has also demonstrated immune response. The CDC could take other more-targeted measures should issues arise in future such as maintaining a list of veterinarians who are ineligible to sign the RVMR for US import for a specified period. This more-targeted action will better ensure compliance by subjecting foreign veterinarians to losing customers should they lose the ability to sign a document for US import. For dogs who arrive without a rabies titer there is already the requirement for rabies re-vaccination plus a 28-day quarantine which obviates rabies risk (at a cost of $4,265 at the Ark at JFK for example). \n\nRE:  DVMRR-restricted countries. Again, why not utilize a more-targeted effort and create a list of specific foreign veterinarians who due to past problems are prohibited from signing off on US import paperwork? If a violation occurs (ie a fraudulent rabies certificate) then the issuing veterinarian as well as the importer can be notified (because the form already captures phone and email) and a list posted on the CDC website of veterinarians by country who have lost priviledges of issuing an RVMR. Utilizing economic forces would seem to be more efficient at eliminating fraud from this system. \n\nThank you for your consideration. \n",

         "I understand the need for strict guidelines to prevent rabies from entering the United States, but they need to be adjusted to high risk animals from high risk countries. You have punished those of us that have our personal pets that are vaccinated properly in the US for rabies and still forcing us to go to specific airports to enter the country. I travel back and forth between Las Vegas and South America and my dog travels with me. My dog is vaccinated for rabies in the United States but I am still being forced to pay more and take longer flights with multiple stopovers because of your rule. I could always fly from South America directly to Las Vegas and now I'm not able to. My dog is vaccinated in the US and I have all the proper CDC paperwork filled out by my vet so why am I being forced to enter the US through one of only 18 listed airports by the CDC? If my dog is not high risk and I have the proper paperwork, I should be able to enter the country through any airport. You are penalizing those of us that do take this matter seriously and make sure we have the proper paperwork and the vaccinations from the US. I'm now forced to fly to LAX and go through customs and the dog check there. Then I have to book a separate flight and pay another $100 for my dog on that flight as opposed to having just one charge for my complete flight, I have two! This also lengthens my trip which forces my dog to have to remain in the carrier longer. My flight from LAX to Las Vegas is $44 for me on Southwest and I have to pay $100 for my dog under the seat because of your rule. They charge my dog more than twice what they charge me. Traveling with a pet is stressful enough without having these extra hurdles placed in front of us forcing us to extend our travel time and pay extra for our travel. I understand the need for these rules from high risk countries but dogs that are vaccinated in the US with the proper paperwork from their vet from the CDC should be enough for us to fly into the country through any airport! You need to be thinking of us, US citizens who also travel but have their pets with them that are properly vaccinated. We should not be penalized for what other countries are doing or breeders or any of those things. I have had my dog for 7 years and she is vaccinated in the US and she should be able to enter the US through any airport like she did for her first five years of her life. These last couple years have been hell because of this rule and very unfair to properly vaccinated dogs. Keep your other rules in place but you need to allow us to fly into any airport with a properly US vaccinated dog! I really hope someone is reading this and realizing that this makes much more sense. You can't have blanket rules that apply the same to properly vaccinated animals and those that are not! Please amend this rule for us vaccinated pets to be able to enter through any international airport in the US! Thank you.",

         "I understand the need for strict guidelines to prevent rabies from entering the United States, but they need to be adjusted to high risk animals from high risk countries. You have punished those of us that have our personal pets that are vaccinated properly in the US for rabies and still forcing us to go to specific airports to enter the country. I travel back and forth between Las Vegas and South America and my dog travels with me. My dog is vaccinated for rabies in the United States but I am still being forced to pay more and take longer flights with multiple stopovers because of your rule. I could always fly from South America directly to Las Vegas and now I'm not able to. My dog is vaccinated in the US and I have all the proper CDC paperwork filled out by my vet so why am I being forced to enter the US through one of only 18 listed airports by the CDC? If my dog is not high risk and I have the proper paperwork, I should be able to enter the country through any airport. You are penalizing those of us that do take this matter seriously and make sure we have the proper paperwork and the vaccinations from the US. I'm now forced to fly to LAX and go through customs and the dog check there. Then I have to book a separate flight and pay another $100 for my dog on that flight as opposed to having just one charge for my complete flight, I have two! This also lengthens my trip which forces my dog to have to remain in the carrier longer. My flight from LAX to Las Vegas is $44 for me on Southwest and I have to pay $100 for my dog under the seat because of your rule. They charge my dog more than twice what they charge me. Traveling with a pet is stressful enough without having these extra hurdles placed in front of us forcing us to extend our travel time and pay extra for our travel. I understand the need for these rules from high risk countries but dogs that are vaccinated in the US with the proper paperwork from their vet from the CDC should be enough for us to fly into the country through any airport! You need to be thinking of us, US citizens who also travel but have their pets with them that are properly vaccinated. We should not be penalized for what other countries are doing or breeders or any of those things. I have had my dog for 7 years and she is vaccinated in the US and she should be able to enter the US through any airport like she did for her first five years of her life. These last couple years have been hell because of this rule and very unfair to properly vaccinated dogs. Keep your other rules in place but you need to allow us to fly into any airport with a properly US vaccinated dog! I really hope someone is reading this and realizing that this makes much more sense. You can't have blanket rules that apply the same to properly vaccinated animals and those that are not! Please amend this rule for us vaccinated pets to be able to enter through any international airport in the US! Thank you.",

         "I would like to propose that alternative options be developed for frequent travelers such as those of us who work for the government or a company that require overseas stays of a year or more (but less than four years).\n\nIn these situations, many of our pets have spent considerable time in the United States (often born there) and have been vaccinated for years by U.S. veterinarians before going overseas.  With our frequent travel, these regulations are having an extremely negative impact on us/our pets.\n\nIn my case, I have two dogs. One, Raja, born in Morocco in 2014 (adopted by me that same year) and the other (Kai) born in the U.S. in 2016 (adopted in 2017). I brought Raja to the U.S. in 2015 where she was again vaccinated yearly for rabies. Kai was as well. We lived in Washington DC for four years and then traveled to South Africa in late 2019 and stayed there for three years with all of their vaccinations up to date.  We went through the CDC permit process to return from South Africa to the United States in July 2022.  We then left for India in September 2022.  My dogs will return to the United States permanently in November of this year.  They were vaccinated again in July 2022 in the United States (one year vaccination as they were not able to get the three year one because they had already been vaccinated again in South Africa (per U.S. regulations) before coming to the U.S.).\n\nI revaccinated the dogs in August of 2023 as we will return to the U.S. in November.  Returning to the U.S., I now have to complete all of the CDC import procedures again and my dogs have to have their blood drawn again, lips pulled back for the teeth photos etc. My return may be delayed if their test results are not received in time. It would be helpful if at least the same time deadlines (waiting three months for the titer etc) were not imposed each trip.  Also would be helpful if, once we have completed a permit request, we would simply need to update the request with proof of current vaccinations etc.\n\n",

         "From the detailed information provided on this new proposed rule, I understand the challenges dealing with the import of dogs that may be infected with rabies. I do feel it is important that in certain situations, dogs who live in the US should be allowed health exemptions with a letter from their veterinarian. All vaccines carry risks and very small, tea cup breeds have the very highest incidences of reactions. In addition to the health implications for a dog that has had reactions to a rabies vaccine, the risk of a very small / tea-cup dog contracting rabies while traveling is extremely low. A consideration for dogs who need to travel out of the US and home but need modifications to the requirements for health reasons should be given the option of a medical professional's letter of exemption. Health certificates and examinations prior to entering the US are prudent and would make sense for all dogs regardless of vaccination status. These exam requirements could take place multiple times, as in a few days before travel and then again on travel day in order to rule out illness or rabies infection entirely. Thank you for your consideration for dogs that may need special accommodation options.",

         "I do not support this proposed rule for several reasons. This regulation will have a big impact on purebred dog populations in the United States, which I am a proud owner and member of. \n\nFirst, certain breeds that originated in Europe require dogs from European breeders to help expand our US breeding pool. It will be very difficult to find breeders that are willing to keep a puppy until 6 months of age due to the puppy forming bonds with the breeder and their existing dogs. This will have a detrimental effect on purebred breeding programs in the U.S.\n\nSecond, the 6 months age requirement should be made exempt for puppies coming from low risk or rabies-free countries. \n\nThird, it is very important for breeders and breed enthusiasts of purebred dogs to be able to import puppies under the age of 6 months in order for them to being forming a bond with their new families and start training. Certain training windows happen earlier than 6 months, such as socialization and desensitization periods. ",

         "The 6-month age requirement for puppies from rabies-free or low-risk countries overlooks the fact that many importers source from ethical, reputable breeders aiming to advance U.S. breeding programs. Holding puppies until they reach six months can hinder purebred initiatives, particularly for rare breeds, due to the bond formed between the puppy and its first home, potentially posing challenges for breeders abroad. Furthermore, the initial months of a puppy's life are crucial for training, socialization, and desensitization—particularly if they are destined for competitions or work. Denying enthusiasts the ability to import younger puppies could undermine training and the formation of essential early bonds.",

         "Exemption of the 6 months age requirement for puppies coming from rabies-free or low-risk countries. \nIndividuals importing puppies from rabies-free or low-risk countries are purchasing their puppies from well known, ethical breeders, typically in an attempt to help further their breeding program here in the United States. It would be difficult to find breeders who are willing to keep a puppy until 6 months of age due to the puppy forming bonds with the breeder and their existing dogs. This could cripple purebred breeding programs of rare breeds in the United States.  \nIt's important that breeders and enthusiasts of purebred dogs are able to import puppies under the age of 6 months. This young age is critical for owners to begin forming a bond with their puppy. Training begins prior to 6 months of age, not having the ability to obtain a puppy younger than 6 months would be detrimental to training wanted behavior and beginning skills of the puppy. These early months are also paramount for socializing and desensitizing a puppy that will be competing or working.  ",

The first few months of a puppy’s life are also so important. It’s beneficial if they can spend time prior to 6 months in their new homes and most reputable breeders won’t send a dog home at the age.

When they started the process to return to the US, they had only a 2 week window to get their dog home otherwise he would have ended up in an foreign SPCA and probably euthanized.  Most foreign countries do not treat animals kindly or are already animal overpopulated.  Preventing these beloved animals to return to the US is utterly heartbreaking for the owner as well as the pet not to mention the children involved.  There needs to be a better solution than banning the return of the animal outright, especially if the owner can prove the animal is fully vaccinated and free from disease.

         "The 6-month age requirement for puppies from rabies-free or low-risk countries overlooks the fact that many importers source from ethical, reputable breeders aiming to advance U.S. breeding programs. Holding puppies until they reach six months can hinder purebred initiatives, particularly for rare breeds, due to the bond formed between the puppy and its first home, potentially posing challenges for breeders abroad. Furthermore, the initial months of a puppy's life are crucial for training, socialization, and desensitization—particularly if they are destined for competitions or work. Denying enthusiasts the ability to import younger puppies could undermine training and the formation of essential early bonds.",

         "Many animal protection organizations, including the Humane Society of the United States and Humane Society International, respond to cruelty and disasters at the request of local communities across the world, and I believe that we should safeguard the capacity of such organizations to transport unowned dogs safely out of these disaster areas and into the United States for adoption. While I support the intention behind this action—it is critical to protect animals and families in the United States from rabies—the proposed rule poses significant burdens on rescue organizations and people traveling with their pets. \n\nThe proposed rule goes far beyond the temporary dog import rule by imposing import requirements on all dogs imported into the United States, regardless of country of origin. The proposed rule does not distinguish between personal and commercially imported dogs, requiring all dogs to be at least 6 months old, bear a microchip and submit a CDC import form prior to travel. Extending these requirements to all dogs will greatly burden the CDC, and I want to express concern over the agency’s ability to handle this dramatically increased regulatory volume. \n\nNotably, the proposed rule asks all importers to prove a negative, that their dog has NOT been in a high-risk rabies country for six months before arriving in the U.S, without providing guidance on how an importer would do so. The severity of being denied admission, and required to return within 72 hours of arrival, is a grave burden for dogs and those trying to help them. Hinging this on a vague, and in many cases impossible, requirement means that many animals who otherwise would have been transported from countries with low or no rabies risk will not be able to be rescued and that even owners travelling with their own pets will be at risk of being denied entry if they don’t provide the proper “proof.”\n\nI appreciate that the proposed rule advocates for airlines to provide safe housing for quarantined dogs and increased transparency around determining cause of death for dogs in their care. I thank the agency for its work, and respectfully request that the agency provide clear instructions for all importers on how to demonstrate that their dogs have not been in a high-risk rabies country for six months before arriving in the U.S. I also ask that the agency reconsider requiring CDC import submission forms for all imported dogs to avoid unnecessary regulatory delay and agency burden.",

         "The impact of Brucellosis on the import of dogs from countries with a high prevalence is a crucial concern that demands our attention. Brucellosis is a highly contagious bacterial infection that can spread among dogs and humans, posing a significant public health risk. To mitigate this risk, it becomes imperative to implement strict measures to prevent the spread of this disease by importing dogs.\n\nOne effective strategy is to focus on importing dogs at a young age, ideally under six months. This approach is rooted in sound reasoning. Dogs under six months of age are less likely to have engaged in sexual activity, reducing the chances of them being carriers of sexually transmitted infections like Brucellosis. This preventive measure addresses a key factor in the transmission of the disease, thereby safeguarding both the imported dogs and the local dog population.\n\nImporting dogs over six months of age, especially those that have not been spayed or neutered, creates a potential challenge. Unaltered street dogs, prevalent in some regions, tend to become sexually active around this age. This increases the risk of Brucellosis transmission through sexual activity. By focusing on importing younger dogs, we minimize this risk and create a healthier foundation for them to adapt to their new homes while reducing the potential for disease transmission.\n\nWith the potential ruling of import restrictions from countries like Mexico to dogs over the age of 6 months, we may be increasing the chance of importing Brucellosis into the US. I therefore ask that we strike this ruling from the proposed rule. ",

These changes will make it harder for dog rescue organizations to do their important work, they will make it harder for people to travel abroad with their pets, and they will complicate the lives of Americans who have been living abroad and wish to return home with dogs.

It also burdens the federal agencies that maintain a presence overseas because these draconian CDC restrictions make it even more difficult to staff already hard-to-fill positions in hardship posts. CDC dog import restrictions have been a continuous topic of conversation in federal employee fora as a central factor in employees’ decisions to a) refuse to take positions in the countries on the CDC’s banned list; b) resign from federal service entirely; and c) discourage others from seeking employment with federal agencies that maintain an overseas presence. Of the incidences of fraud that the CDC has documented, 0% involved U.S. federal government employees. These faithful servants of the American people should not be punished because of the actions of unscrupulous “animal rescue” organizations. Any permanent rule should have a narrow application to people and organizations that are actually causing problems. At a minimum, there should be exemptions for federal employees traveling on official orders.",

I want to voice my concern about the proposed changes and express that I am NOT in favor of the regulations as written. \n\nThe proposed regulations would substantially hinder responsible breeders' ability to introduce new lineage into the dog population. In order to ensure the health of our canine companions, and prevent inbreeding, new puppies often need to be acquired from overseas, and waiting until these puppies are 6 months of age would pose a stumbling block for these breeders.\n\nAdditionally, besides breeders, it is critical for dog enthusiasts to be able to start bonding, training, and socialization with their animal prior to 6 months. Those critical early months are crucial for ensuring well-behaved dogs - whether they are going to be working, competing, or simply companions.\n\nMy proposed change would be to adjust the language so that individuals may import dogs younger than 6 months from rabies-free, low-risk countries.\n\nThank you so much for your time and attention.\nCharlotte Wyman",

As the world continues to shrink in terms of global travel and movement, we are faced with dealing with potential disease vectors from other places.\n\nThis is, of course, is not a new problem; but it is something begging for immediate attention. I am reminded of a book by E. Fuller Torrey, MD and Robert H. Yolken, MD titled: Beasts of the Earth: Animals, Humans and Disease. \n\nhttps://www.rutgersuniversitypress.org/beasts-of-the-earth/9780813571430\n\nAnd while I can understand the desire of people to bring their beloved pets with them when they move, the U.S. needs more stringent rules on the transporting of animals into the country. \n\nMost especially, the US needs to look at all the animal rescues working to bring strays and other abandoned dogs from foreign countries into the U.S. I think we can all agree there are enough animals here needing homes; rescues should not be allowed to ship animals into the US from overseas.\n\nThank you for your time and attention to this important matter.",

         "I understand the CDC concern, but there are 119 countries designated as \"high risk\" for rabies.  I am in Ecuador, and noone in the GoE can tell me their statistics on rabies.  So how does CDC know that Ecuador is a high risk country?  Also, diplomats need to be exempt from this requirement if they are just transporting their family dogs back to the US.  I am going through the process right now, and just to get my Chihuahua into compliance is costing over $1,000.  Thankfully, the State Department has included allowances to enable me to get reimbursed, but this is an unnecessary burden to my family and unnecessary cost to the taxpayer.  We had to send our titer test sample to the Kansas State University because there are no other CDC-approved facilities here in Ecuador.  Also, the GoE has a very extensive and thorough process to EXPORT dogs from here which includes many of the same requirements that the CDC has imposed.  Seems redundant.",

He is part of our family and leaving him behind once our tour is over is not an option for us. Under the current CDC guidelines, we are already concerned about navigating the process to bring him back to the United States with us and know it will require extension financial resources and time to make happen (many of our friends have gone through the painful process). The new CDC guidelines will make the process even more difficult and I worry impossible for us to navigate. This places a huge burden on foreign services officers who are required to live abroad as part of our jobs and in service to the country to meet U.S. needs abroad. We sacrifice a lot to be here and asking us to sacrifice traveling with our pets I think is too high of an ask. I ask that the CDC consider an exemption or alternate process for U.S. foreign service officers. Thank you for your consideration. ",

I am deeply concerned that these proposed changes will impose even greater challenges for our family we return home with with our dog.\n\nMoving \"River\", our sweet golden retriever, around between my work assignments in Uzbekistan and India is already incredibly confusing, difficult, and expensive. My 6 kids would be devastated to not have their dog, as we establish a new home moving around every 2 year.

Our dog spends his entire life here on a secure compound, with little contact with other dogs, all of whom are also fully vaccinated and regularly examined by a veterenarian. However, the proposed rule would require certification by two foreign vets, an expensive titer test (which we would have to obtain, at our own expense, from a lab in a third country) and would apparently eliminate his ability to return to the United States on the same flight as us at the end of our assignments. We are public servants, far from our friends and family at home, and our dog is a vital support to our small children as they navigate life in a foreign country. I urge the CDC to make an exception for members of the Foreign Service and the military, who already face so many challenges bringing our beloved pets with us as we serve the American people in difficult situations.",

         "I am writing to request an exemption to this rule for U.S. government employees overseas (both Military and Foreign Service of all federal agencies). \n\nI am a Foreign Service Officer (FSO) serving the people of the United States abroad. When I swore my oath to the U.S. Constitution, I also promised to serve wherever my country needs me. That includes in the less developed part of the world--which make up the vast majority of our overseas posts. I am also a parent with a small child and a dog who is his constant companion. When my family is moved from post to post, our dog moves as well. These moves include lengthy stops in the United States. (This is not optional as by Congressional order all FSOs must spend a period of \"Home Leave\" in the U.S., and most professional training is done in Washington.) \n\nI cannot tell you how hard it already is to move a family and a dog from country to country. The process is already complex and expensive, and the sheer number of medical documents required mean our dogs often get better healthcare overseas than us humans do. (The airlines alone make it almost impossible, but even they have an exemption for Military and Foreign Service moves.) However, we do it because our pets are one of the view sources of stability and constancy in our constantly transitory lives. We don't have the privilege to put down roots in any one community, so we have to invest that love and energy into what we can take with us.\n\nThe Foreign Service and Military communities are not the ones who are flaunting the rules and regulations for pet importation. By our very nature we are bureaucrats and rule-followers. We take care of our pets and keep them healthy. When we travel with them, we spend an inordinate amount of uncompensated time making sense of the rules and executing them. \n\nHowever, the new rules seem like we're set up to fail. \n\nIf our dogs got a rabies vaccine in the U.S. before deployment, many of our overseas tours longer than the period of efficacy. They of course get boosters overseas, but these boosters would be considered as having the same statutory validity. Given also that most FSOs transfer in the summer months, there is a real risk that the designated labs for titter tests will be overwhelmed and unable to process results in time.\n\nThe biggest problem however is the 5 designated airports as ports of entry. When traveling on government orders, as we do when we depart/return to the U.S. for our assignments, we DO NOT get to choose our flights or our route. These are determined by a separate agreement between the air carriers and the Federal government to establish a \"city pair\" rate, that all official travel must use. There are rare exceptions to this, but pet transport is not one of them. \n\nThe findings in this document name cases of rabies dog importation in recent years, all of which are from agents shipping dogs \"for adoption.\" None are from U.S. citizens trying to bring their dogs home.\n\nThe fight against rabies is a laudable one given the real public health risks. However, please do not punish the law-abiding civil and military personnel, and most importantly their families. Please grant an exception for those traveling on government orders. We willingly sacrifice a lot in service to our country, at least let us keep our corgi. ",

         "While I understand the concerns of the CDC regarding fraudulent rabies vaccine reports and the concern for the general safety of pets imported from \"high-risk\" countries, the process for importing pets is becoming far too difficult for those of us serving our country overseas at diplomatic and military posts worldwide. As a State Department Foreign Service family, our two dogs are integral members of our clan and make our lives so much fuller. Moving from country to country every 2 or 3 years has a very stressful impact on our children, but having their beloved pets means having a continuous friend wherever we land. We love them as if they were our children and the thought of not being able to bring them home with us upon returning to the US is unbearable and would devastate our family! \n\nWith the recent CDC ban on pets entering the U.S., many U.S. airlines have already taken licenses to reduce their liability by refusing to fly pets at all, which has been particularly challenging for those of us forced to travel using the \"Fly America Act\". Between heat embargos and the ban, it is becoming nearly impossible to keep our families together.  A typical foreign service spouse or officer has to spend dozens of hours arranging for a multitude of veterinary tests, phone calls to airlines to secure reservations, hiring pet shippers, and praying for success in getting their pets to their onward assignment. It takes away from our work and adds tremendous stress to an already tumultuous period in our lives.\n\nI think that you'll find that the average foreign service family is spending thousands of dollars to move their furry family members from post to post. For us, it is totally worth the cost and shows our dedication to the welfare of our pets. Obviously, if we invest so much time and money into our pets, we also are keeping them in good health. We make every effort to ensure that our dogs are healthy and would not spend so much time and money if we weren't concerned with their physical and medical state and we seek out the best veterinary care. \n\nI understand that some overseas breeders or rescue organizations may not have the same level of care for the animals that they attempt to import, but why should government service personnel be punished for the shortcomings of those groups? Please, for the sake of our military and State Department families, consider including an exception or exemption for government employees so that we can keep our families intact. We've already sacrificed so much for our nation, please don't deny us our pets! \n\nThank you for your consideration, \nSabrina Volciak\nForeign Service Spouse, mother of 5, and puppy parent of Harlee & Olivia\nU.S.Embassy Seoul, Republic of South Korea\n",

         "Dear Colleagues:\n\nI would like to voice my opposition to the proposed change or at least to respectfully request an exception for the pets of employees of the United States Government posted abroad.\n\nI have been a member of the U.S. Foreign Service of the State Department for nearly two decades.  That service requires personal sacrifices on the part of the employee, but also places an even greater burden on family members including children.  In a lifestyle defined by change in service of country, our family pets are some of the only consistent elements that help anchor our children across many moves.  When we move back to the United States next year from China, we will have completed three years of service where we were subjected to draconian movement restrictions, highlighted by a two-month complete lockdown which prompted the U.S. government to evacuate my family back to the United States.  It took some time to find a new normal after my family was finally reunited after again being subjected to quarantine and extreme testing measures.  \n\nAs currently drafted, the regulations would mean that we would be potentially separated from our beloved 7 lb dog for an indefinite period of time.  China's own strict regulations require rabies vaccination early and the country employs an extensive monitoring program.  We would also be willing to subject our pet to additional testing to prove it posed no threat to the American public upon our return.\n\nI respectfully request that the CDC consider making exceptions for families like mine which are working to protect our country abroad and want to have our families intact upon our return home.\n\nRegards,\n\nDaniel K. Delk, Jr.",

         "Hi - \n\nI request that the CDC creates an exemption from this rule for the personal pets of United States Government Employees on assignment abroad returning to the United States on official travel orders.  The proposed rule creates an extraordinary burden on those employees who are assigned overseas in key national security positions as Foreign Service Officers, Military personnel, and civil servants for periods of two to five years with their families and often their family pets.  While the risk of rabies is certainly higher in many overseas locations and the CDC has noted an increased risk from rescue dogs and large pet shippers with creative paperwork, this is simply not the case for the much smaller group of US Personnel on official orders overseas with personal pets.  \n\nIn my case, I have a small dog that I adopted in Virginia five years ago.  Before departing for my overseas post in Pretoria, I was able to vaccinate her for rabies through my American vet.  I have now done a direct transfer from South Africa to Thailand after a three year tour, before which I obtained rabies boosters from a qualified vet using US approved vaccine.  I will be here for three years and then will bring my dog back to the states.  Even though there are highly qualified vets, approved vaccinations commercially available, I will be required under the new rules (as I will have an expired US vaccination and two overseas vaccinations) to provide extensive vaccination documents, two vet certificates, and a titter test.  Additionally, I have to only enter at certain ports of entry that do not align with my department travel regulations as approved points of entry (meaning that I am out of pocket for substantial costs as I am no longer eligible for GSA city pair fares if I do not follow approved routings), then I have to revaccinate my dog and face delays and out of pocket costs.\n\nSurely there is a way to review the small number of animals entering the United States from US Government personnel on official travel with personal pets (long standing family companions and not large batches of rescue dogs from unknown origin) and the look at the risk and devise a much simpler process and system that protects America from rabies risks but doesn't apply a massive one-size-fits-all solution completely disproportionate to the risk.\n\nHaving to deal with the new regulations will further burden my family with bureaucratic distractions while I am supposed to be focused on doing key national security work and ultimately will reduce my willingness to serve overseas.  Please make this easier and cheaper for those sacrificing for our country in so many other ways.",

         "As a diplomat serving the United States overseas, the restrictions imposed by the CDC for the importation of cats and dogs are onerous.  Members of the Department of State, Military, USAID, and other agencies take their pets with them to many countries - often for years.  Then cannot bring their pets back home.  Many people adopt pets overseas in countries that do not have access to titer tests or 3-year rabies vaccines.  \n\nI am serving in Africa, and at this time can only obtain a one-year rabies vaccine for my dog.  In order to bring my dog back to the US, I will have to wait until he is revaccinated this fall, then have the vet draw blood, ask the Health Unit at post to prepare the blood for testing, carry it with me to the US, before submitting to a CDC-approved clinic.  \n\nNow, the CDC wants me to have certification from TWO vets?  Why?  Do both vets have to vaccinate my dog?  Or does one watch while the other vaccinates the dog?  And if the CDC is demanding the dog be vaccinated upon arrival in the US, then why do I need certificates from two vets at all?\n\nCan the CDC produce a report that shows how many US Citizens traveling on a diplomatic passport brought a rabies-infected pet into the US in the past ten years?  If not, what is their reasoning for imposing such ridiculous requirements.  I have traveled with my dog from the US to Colombia, Cambodia, Brazil and Mali. There has never been a health problem. ",

Asking me as a Foreign Service officer to jump through expensive bureaucratic hoops to bring back my dog to the United States - only to have her exposed to rabies in her own backyard - is frankly pretty silly.  In addition, the expense of this program to the U.S. taxpayer for the very small chance a foreign vaxxed dog has rabies is abusive to the taxpayer, including me!  If you want, make the owners re-vax within 30 days of entry or something.  This program is going to cost millions in additional USG facilities, employees, form verification etc, not to mention the tens of thousands that will need to be spent my U.S. military and foreign service families returning home with their four-footed family members.

Getting our dog re-vaccinated for rabies and working with a local veterinarian familiar with the requirements to submit the titer sample to a CDC-certified lab and completing the paperwork required was time consuming and expensive.  I don't understand why USG government employees and military members must be subjected to these restrictions especially considering how difficult and stressful a change of station already is for family members and pets.  The thought that CDC may make these restrictions even more severe, requiring re-vaccination of a pet upon arrival, would be unconscionable.  Why subject USG family pets to this abuse?  Why isn't a titer sample from a CDC certified lab sufficient?  Please reconsider these requirements and allow USG employees and military members to be exempted.",

         "I am a member of the US Department of State Senior Foreign Service, currently serving as an Ambassador in a Middle Eastern country. I urge CDC to extend a waiver or exemption to this policy for United States government personnel assigned outside the USA. We serve abroad to promote and protect the United States, at the pleasure of the President and Secretary of State. We do not choose where we go but rather go where we are directed. Exactly the same as members of the United States military. To maintain a modicum of normality, many of us - including me - bring our pet dogs with us when assigned abroad. The presence of our dogs benefits the employees and their families, especially children, helping them to cope with huge pressures and stressors stemming from life away from friends and families. Creating expensive, timely, and highly burdensome rules regarding importing, or reimporting, dogs to the US serves as a disincentive to public service and being assigned abroad. We may find a direct negative impact on retention of our personnel. Most importantly, families are likely to be without their pets for significant periods of time – when the pets are needed most. Your proposed rule penalizes proud and brave Americans serving their country. There is no reason for it. Extending a waiver or exemption to US government employees serving their country abroad is logical, humane, and will not increase the risk of rabies in the United States, as long as dogs are properly vaccinated and have a health certificate from a local vet. We're all on the same team - please support us!",

         "As a member of the U.S. Foreign Service currently posted to Africa, I strongly urge the CDC to reconsider this change in requirements.  Specifically, introducing a requirement for airlines to verify the proper documentation of dogs they would transport will further disincentivize airlines from being willing to transport dogs as accompanied baggage, a process that is significantly less expensive and less burdensome than transportation as cargo.  As things stand, a growing number of U.S. flag airlines will not transport dogs in hold; the proposed change would only make this harder.  The import restrictions introduced in 2019 led many airlines to refuse to transport dogs into the U.S. - which nearly led to our U.S.-vaccinated dog being left behind when our family was ordered to evacuate Ethiopia in 2021.  The current requirements for re-importing our family pets into the U.S. are stringent, but can be managed.  \n\nPlease do not make it any more difficult for Foreign Service and other families serving abroad to bring our dogs home.  They are members of our families and their presence in posts around the world adds immeasurably to the morale of U.S. government employees and our families stationed overseas.  We were stationed in Egypt in 2019 when the current import restrictions were introduced, and it added thousands of dollars of non-reimbursable expense to the cost of bringing our fully vaccinated dog back to the U.S. with us; ultimately, though, we were able to bring our dog home.  When we tried to bring the same dog home from Ethiopia in 2021, Turkish Airlines refused to transport him or any other dogs out of Addis Ababa if the final destination was the U.S., because of concerns about the rabies import restrictions.  We can work within the documentation requirements; a change to the restrictions for airlines, however, would close many flight options to bring our pets home with us.  Please do not do this.\n\n-Ruth A. Stevens-Klitz, U.S. Embassy Dakar, Senegal",

I am writing to urge that the CDC recommendations not become permanent. As part of my job requirements, I move every 1-4 years, making it very difficult to comply with the regulation of US Vaccination. For example, I have very clear records in ES, and my dog is vaccinated with US grade rabies vaccinations yearly. Creating additional steps to bring her home for the 2 months I have between tours puts undue stress on her, and my family as we leave our countries of residence.  There are better ways to ensure rabies vaccine compliance.  The incidence of rabies cases in ES is very low, not high, as the CDC website indicates.  I think better information and a nuanced approach would benefit all pet owners.  Perhaps the CDC could also make an exception for USG employees working overseas.  ",

We will be returning with them in May of 2024 to take up an assignment in Washington.  The proposed rules for returning pets to the United States puts an onerous burden upon those who are serving our nation overseas in tough places.  \n\nAs a diplomat in a country with a history of cyclical violence, I know about managing risks.  I respect that the intent of CDC is to prevent dangerous infections from reaching the U.S.  But making the requirements unnecessarily onerous does not manage risk as much as prevent people like me from taking tough assignments.\n\nWe keep our dogs healthy and current in all their vaccinations not because the CDC says to, but because we love our dogs.  I urge the CDC to consider the unique situations of U.S. diplomats and other serving the nation overseas as your consider these rules.  \n\nYou cannot eliminate risk, but you can manage it in ways that doesn't penalize those of us working overseas in service to our country.  \n\nSincerely,\nKeith R.

         "I think it is ironic that the “Commenter’s Checklist” admonishes the public to base its arguments against this outrageous CDC overreach on science and reason. The CDC has no cogent scientific, statistical, or rational basis for its proposed rule. As the poster child for incompetent bureaucracy, it seeks to solve problems that don’t exist and create expensive, redundant, irrelevant process requirements. Three rabid dogs over a period of seven years does not justify this lunacy or the designation of 119 countries as high-risk. Fraud on the part of a foreign animal rescues does not justify so substantially burdening private citizens and especially U.S. government officials abroad who seek to return home with their family pets. \n\nThe CDC wants to keep the USA free of DMRVV — great, that’s a goal we can all support. But the proposed rules go far beyond what is necessary for the USA — and what has been demonstrated necessary for ANY OTHER RABIES FREE COUNTRY — to keep rabies out. Microchip and vaccination certificate and/or microchip and titer can all be justified. Everything else creates a pointless bureaucratic hell for literally every stakeholder involved, including “partner” U.S. government agencies. \n\nUSDA endorsement of a vaccine certificate issued by a U.S. licensed veterinarian is nonsensical. Creating a new form to add to the pile is ridiculous. The “reasoning” provided for the proposed rule says nothing of systemic or even occasional problems with fraud related to U.S. issued vaccine certificates or the existing CDC form that doesn’t require endorsement. So why is the CDC proposing to waste everyone’s time and resources — including the taxpayer — to solve a nonexistent problem? The CDC doesn’t have a good reason. It’s that simple. \n\nThe CDC instituted draconian restrictions with little to no justification in the first place, blamed the pandemic, then extended its “temporary ban” year after year, has documented zero cases of imported dog rabies since, and — despite the current restrictions being demonstrably more than sufficient — somehow has decided to impose FURTHER restrictions to dog importation PERMANENTLY. If the CDC were an individual, it would be diagnosed with paranoia and panic disorder. The public shouldn’t be constantly punished by the CDC’s inability to apply logic and science to the real world. You can’t contract HIV by shaking hands with someone, and you don’t need this amount of red tape to keep the USA DMRVV-free. \n\nThe proposed rule states that animals from “high risk countries” that comply with all the requirements, including titer from an approved lab and vaccine certificate endorsed by the exporting country’s government vet, still have to be re-vaccinated upon arrival at port of entry. What is the point of requiring endorsement of documents if you’re just going to treat them as invalid anyway and re-vaccinate the animals? Logically, if foreign vaccine certificates aren’t going to be considered valid, regardless of endorsements or any other authentications, then there is no point whatsoever in requiring people to supply them for review by CDC/USDA/CBP. The odds of an animal with an acceptable titer result carrying rabies is roughly zero. If foreign vaccinations are so unacceptable, then just disregard them, require the titer, and re-vaccinate on arrival. Otherwise, accept the rabies certificate and titer and stop wasting everyone’s time re-vaccinating already vaccinated dogs at POE. \n\nOkay. Let’s deal with the import permit for a moment. What purpose does it actually serve? What due diligence is done on these permits (especially that justifies the months it takes to process them)? If the CDC were actually verifying U.S.-issued rabies certificates in advance to streamline arrival procedures, then it would make sense. But as it stands, it’s just another pointless hoop that CDC wastes time/money/staff holding and people traveling with their dogs waste time/money/stress jumping through. The proposed rule explains no actual purpose for the import permit nor is there any evidence offered that it has made one bit of difference to preventing rabies than vaccination certificates and titers provide on their own. \n\nCompared with simple processes and documentation required by the rest of the rabies-free word, this pile of red tape proposed by the CDC does not further reduce the risk of importation of rabies in any meaningful way. What it does is create a self-licking CDC ice cream cone. What it does is impose unacceptable burdens on U.S. government personnel serving their country in positions of strategic importance. What it does is unduly burden the CDC’s so-called “implementing partners” (do they really have a choice?), the USDA and CBP. What it does is cost the taxpayer millions that completely dwarf the supposed $400,000 post-exposure prophylaxis cost that is being used to justify these insane regulations.",

         "I'm aware of the extremely legitimate concerns regarding imported unknown, foreign dogs whose health & medical history is as unknown as the origins of the dog itself, however, to apply a blanket regulation on the age of puppies coming into the United States is an undue burden pressed upon small, ethical breeders who are working hard to better the breeding populations of dogs within the US, particularly those of us in rarer breeds. Puppies, being imported to the US, one or two puppies at a time, who themselves have been raised with care in the homes of small breeders abroad are not the same situation as unknown, \"puppy mill\" and \"rescued\" street dogs/pariah dogs found internationally. Although the risk of disease through these unknown dogs is legitimate, it is entirely a separate circumstance from individual dogs whose health and pedigree are known to both the exporting party and the importing party. These new rules, if passed as they are, will require Americans looking to import dogs into their breeding program to pay the exporter for an additional three to four months of care for the puppy, miss out on valuable training and bonding time with the dog, and place those burdens on the exporting family. In turn, depending on the size of the dog, the importing process under the belly of the plane places undue stress on a still-young animal. That is, of course, if the exporting party lets the dog leave their country of origin at all: six months raising & loving & training a dog only to send them thousands of miles away is a tall ask, nevermind the burden of raising the dog for that long, when the dog could simply be sold domestically. All of these concerns, human though they may be, are just the immediate concerns that come to mind when faced with this potential reality. Long-term, in rare and emerging breeds within the United States (those breeds participating in AKC's Foundation Stock Service & Misc. Class, as well as rarer breeds who have full recognition), we will see a depletion of quality & the lack of access to \"new lines\" will prevent the population from safely growing within the US. The risks of freezing & collecting semen and importing are significant, as there is never a guarantee of pregnancy, and often the best decision we may make for our smaller breeding programs is the import of a puppy, and place our hopes on that dog's health and conformation maturing into what we hope for. There simply must be a way to establish a international health certificate in Europe based on the parents known vaccine status, the presence of disease within a country, and further the health assessment on the young dog(s) in question-- that will decrease the risk of disease, increase the standard that imported, rescued dogs are held to, and allow dogs to enter into this country without the importing party missing out on critical socialization time with their young dogs. These dogs may be bred, eventually, following breed specific health testing, but they are all ultimately pets who are quite loved, and these rules stand to benefit very few, if any, people or animals in particular and likely will have lasting negative implications on both rescue dog populations and those importing known, well-bred dogs of good pedigree & health",

         "I am writing as an USG employee.  My family and I have been serving our country, primarily overseas, for the last 20 years, and have lived in seven different countries during that time. We rescued a couple kittens, while serving at our first overseas post.  While those sweet kitties died, we have since rescued a dog and a cat.  All of our pets have become beloved and important members of our family through our entire career.  With the many transitions we experience, having pets makes the biggest difference for our children's emotional well beings through these transfers.  \n\n\n Because we love our animals dearly, we have been diligent and meticulous about ensuring that they are always current on ALL of their vaccinations and see that they have have regular health care screenings. Over the years, we have come to know many, many other American families serving overseas, whether with the Department of State, the U.S. Armed Forces, or another government agency, and have observed nothing less than the same level of commitment toward ensuring that their pets are always well cared for and current on their vaccinations.\n\nAnyone who has moved overseas with a beloved pet knows all too well the many metaphorical hoops we already need to jump through, which are extremely time intensive and costly, in order to ensure that we have the appropriate health care certifications and documentation in order to enter the countries to which we travel and also back to the U.S. upon our return. I fully support ensuring that our animals are protected against rabies and providing documentation to demonstrate that; however, the additional restrictions imposed upon government personnel and their families in order to move their pets back to the U.S. from the high-risk rabies countries add untold hardship and stress during the already very stressful process of relocating from a foreign country. I have personally witnessed many families scramble - even with advanced planning and preparation - to complete all of the currently necessary steps to ensure that they can re-enter the U.S. with their dogs, adding an additional layer of stress and anxiety to their PCS (permanent change of station) moves.\n\nPersonally, my family very narrowly missed having to figure out how to bring our dog safely home from Ethiopia in 2021, when we had to evacuate due to civil unrest.   We were given only a day or two to pack up our belongings and complete all of the necessary steps required for a transition back to the U.S. from a diplomatic mission. Had the CDC’s dog importation suspension been in place at the time that we had to leave, we would have faced an impossible situation and the very real and heartbreaking prospect of having to leave our beloved pets behind. The thought of this makes me sick to my stomach... especially considering that we had just served nearly three years in a hostile country during the worst of the Covid pandemic. On many days, it was the comfort of our pets that got us through those challenging times.\nI respectfully ask that the CDC please consider very carefully the many negative effects that these proposed regulations will have on tens of thousands of government  personnel and their families who are serving the country overseas. While yes, we have chosen our careers and lifestyles of constant relocation, this does not mean that it is easy. We serve our country proudly and our pets provide an indescribable level of comfort and support while we are away from our families and friends back home. If these new regulations absolutely must go into effect, I propose an exemption for government personnel serving overseas in countries that are considered high risk for rabies. As mentioned above, I can understand and support requiring us to provide documentation of rabies vaccination, as has always been the case, but to add all of the additional layers of red tape in order simply to bring our furry family members home from the often challenging locations where we are serving on behalf the U.S. causes an enormous amount of stress and hardship during the already very difficult process of relocating internationally.\nThank you for your time and consideration.",

         "I urge decision-makers not to support the proposed HHS rule regarding the importation of dogs and cats without significant modifications/exemptions for U.S. servicemembers and U.S. public servants stationed overseas on behalf of the U.S. government.  This rule imposes undue difficulties on servicemembers and public servants, such as Department of State Foreign Service personnel, who are already assuming tremendous security, financial, and personal hardships to move their families abroad in support of U.S. national interests.  The HHS rule appears to be focused on “incomplete or fraudulent rabies vaccination certificates” and “criminal networks involved in the lucrative dog trade”.  Neither of these categories apply to public servants and military members.  These U.S. citizens understand the importance of full compliance with U.S. rules and regulations, particularly as they impact public health in the United States.  The majority of the dogs and cats traveling with these U.S. citizens were born in the United States and cared for by U.S. vets.  Those adopted by families overseas receive extensive treatment by foreign vets, in compliance with U.S. best practices for animal care.  By imposing such harsh restrictions on U.S. public servants and military personnel, the CDC is discounting the trust that the U.S. government already places in such personnel to best represent the interests of the United States, including the duty to keep the U.S. homeland safe from public health threats.  It is the height of irony that the U.S. government would spend hundreds of thousands of dollars vetting military servicemembers and public servants for high security clearances, only to turn around and say that they cannot be trusted to ensure their pets are properly vaccinated.  By forcing U.S. servicemembers and public servants to follow the proposed rules, HHS will be forcing these families to incur significant financial hardships and additional stress in altering travel arrangements under the guise of addressing a threat that simply does not exist among this demographic of traveler.  Families who cannot afford to shoulder this burden will be faced with the unthinkable decision of having to re-home pets that have become members of their family.  If we are asking servicemembers and public servants to assume risks by taking hardships assignments outside the United States, we must trust them to comply with existing U.S. regulations.  If this act is to go forward, it simply must have an exemption built in for personnel overseas on official U.S. government orders.\n\nThank you.",

         "I am a US government employee and a public health veterinary serving my country abroad with my family and my dog. I appreciate the opportunity to comment on CDC’s proposed rulemaking regarding the import of dogs and cats into the United States. The impetus of this law resulted from numerous cases of fraudulent import paperwork and the importation of dogs with rabies. The intent of this law is to prevent additional occurrences and protect public health by preventing the reintroduction and spread of dog-maintained rabies virus variant (DMRVV) in the United States. I understand the intent of the law and the concern for public health however I ask the CDC to consider and mitigate the unintended consequences of this proposed rule. As it stands, this proposed rule is detrimental to US government employees serving their country abroad who navigate the complicated animal health requirements of many countries as they move their companion animals with them. \n\nAs I read the executive summary of the rule, I see ‘importation’ again and again. The CDC needs to better define what conditions they are considering when they are  talking about ‘importation’ and what activity they are trying to regulate. When US government personnel return to the US after being posted abroad, we are not ‘importing’ our dogs or cats. We are returning to the US with our family and our pets generally for a short period of time before we are sent to our next post. During this time, we seek the medical care we could not receive overseas, we attend to the needs of family that remained in the US, we take care of personnel and financial matters, and we receive training to prepare us for our next post. Categorizing our pets as imports, requiring them to enter only through certain ports, and mandating a quarantine period puts an undue burden on a group of public servants who already get enough of that with these emotionally, mentally, and physically demanding careers we have chosen for the public good. \nWe follow the rules of animal transport, vaccination, and animal health all because we want the best for our pets and we want them to be able to move with us and will not risk their loss. We pose little threat to the DMRVV-free status of the US and are unlikely to be associated with fraudulent paperwork. I ask that the CDC grant an exception to the requirements in this proposed rule, either through the definition of import, acknowledgement of government and military personnel in the rule, or in some other manner. Moving away from a country of origin focused rule to an end use focused rule (sale/adoption versus companion animal) should also be considered. \n\nI understand that the CDC makes decisions in the interest of protecting public health and hope the CDC works to understand the situation of US government personnel and their companion animals, and reconsiders the extent and applicability of the proposed rule and makes an exception for US Government personnel. The CDC is basically exiling me from returning to the US until my dogs dies, so thanks for that. \nHHS/CDC also proposes to prohibit or otherwise restrict importation of dogs into the United States from certain countries that have a history of exporting dogs infected with DMRVV to other countries or have demonstrated a lack of appropriate veterinary controls to prevent the exportation of rabid dogs: An exception for US government personnel should be added here. We have no control over where we are posted and should not pay the price because we are serving our country abroad with our family which incudes our companion animals. It also doesn’t help that CDC has designated most countries as DMRVV high risk countries. \nPrior to traveling out of the United States, a USDA-Accredited Veterinarian would need to complete and sign a form titled “ Certification of U.S.-issued Rabies Vaccination for Live Dog Re-entry into the United States.” - Does this form exist – have you coordinated with USDA VS to create this form? What is your educational campaign to provide it to all of the accredited vets and make sure vet clinics know they need this? Also, what are you going to do for people like me who are already overseas? What if I don’t return for 5 more years? You are complicating an already complicating process by requiring yet another form. And expecting people to hold on to the form for the 2-4 years they are at post. Or even longer if we don’t come home between posts. \nRegarding quarantine facilities -  I do not see the CDC having staff to coordinate this quarantine process and how will it be funded? This seems like tax payers will pay the burden. \n",

In addition to duplicative requirements which seem to serve little purpose (for example, verification of the vaccination by titer test and re-vaccination even once the first vaccination has been verified) the lack of flexibility with which it has been implemented is remarkable.  The CDC has shown inflexibility at every step of the way, refusing to make things simpler for military and foreign service members who own pets and also not following the letter of their own rules.  Last time I returned to the US with a dog, I received an authorization which stated it was valid at any of the approved ports of entry.  Yet, when I had to change to another additional port of entry, this created problems on re-entry, even though the CDC permit specifically stated this was authorized.  This rigid and inflexible approach does not help protect the US from rabies and does a huge disservice to those serving our country overseas.",

She spent 2 years of her life living in an outdoor kennel exposed to the elements with 3,000 other dogs. No one even gave her a glance because she is not a pure bred dog. A wonderful rescue brought her to us and she has become a wonderful addition to our family. There are so many other dogs like her who could find loving homes in the United States.

Rabies is extremely rare in domestic cases, therefore it is an issue with the wild animal population. It does not make sense to punish rescue organizations for something out of their control. This is a half-baked measure that will have insignificant benefits and will cause suffering to innocent animals.\n \nNon-profit organizations in the United States and individuals go to extraordinary lengths to rescue dogs from wars and climate disasters around the world. We should continue to make it safe and feasible. \n\nIn 2020 dogs accounted for just 1% (36) of all rabies cases in the US. In the past eight years, there have only been 4 cases of rabies from imported dogs. \n \nThe new proposed laws are unclear and an overstep. They burden nonprofit rescue organizations and private individuals with extreme costs and requirements that are nearly impossible to achieve for those working in war-torn countries like Ukraine. \n \nI strongly ask the agency to reconsider these proposed measures and refocus their efforts on rabies prevention to wildlife and livestock where regulations are truly needed to stop the disease in the United States.

I don’t see why harsher restrictions need to be placed on rescues/individuals that are doing their due diligence to safely and humanely bring these animals to the US. My dog came from Russia and she’s lovely. Kind of crazy, but that’s a result of her breed rather than any disease. She arrived in the US fully vetted and my local vet did a full work up on her at her first appointment. These dogs don’t represent a problem to the level that these restrictions cover. The restrictions will result in the deaths of a lot of animals that could have found caring homes there. Please reconsider this. I know it’s not the most pressing issue that you’ll all deal with, but my dog provided an incredible amount of comfort and was integral to my mental health.

Please, do not make the mistake of making it hard for animals to move across borders with their families. Homeless dogs, outside the U.S., run the risk of being denied a happy and loving home and life. All animals deserve the chance for a happy life. The homeless dog population in other countries could decline if they are allowed in the States. Other countries and people do not always treat animals with the same love and caring as we do here. Animals entering the U.S. are required to have a valid rabies certificate. Changing policy will cause an undue hardship on people and the homeless dogs. Please consider this law carefully and you will realize that it is in the best interest of anyone.\n\nSincerely,\nWendy Asher",

We now have two dogs and they are very much a part of our family. Over the years we’ve experienced increased costs and bureaucratic hurdles to traveling with our dogs, but we are dedicated to keeping them as they are truly family members. They have grown up with our children and provide unparalleled companionship and comfort during our numerous transitions between posts. With so many countries involved with this ban, the posts we are comfortable bidding on have drastically decreased. We want to serve overseas in a variety of countries and cultures as part of the Foreign Service, but we need to be confident that our furry family members will be able to arrive and depart with us. Leaving them behind is simply not an option. We are federal government employees and we provide high quality care for our dogs and abide by the rules.

         "I’m an animal lover and am writing today to oppose the proposed ruling, “Control of Communicable Disease; Foreign Quarantine: Importation of Dogs and Cats.” \n \nI support the CDC’s intention to protect the United States against additional rabies cases, however I do not agree that hardening the rules on dog importation is the way to achieve this goal. According to the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases there are approximately 5,000 confirmed cases of rabies in animals in the United States and the vast majority are found in wildlife. Why harden the rules on dog importation, especially for responsible non-profits and individuals? \n \nNon-profit organizations in the United States and individuals go to extraordinary lengths to rescue dogs from wars and climate disasters around the world. We should not close our doors to this work but instead continue to make it safe and feasible for it to continue. In 2020 dogs accounted for just 1% (36) of all rabies cases in the US. In the past eight years, there have only been 4 cases of rabies from imported dogs. \n \nThe new proposed laws are unclear and an overstep. They burden nonprofit rescue organizations and private individuals with extreme costs and requirements that are nearly impossible to achieve for those working in war-torn countries like Ukraine. \n \nI strongly ask the agency to reconsider these proposed measures and refocus their efforts on rabies prevention to wildlife and livestock where regulations are truly needed to stop the disease in the United States.",

Many homeless dogs who could otherwise have found new homes in the U.S. will suffer and die as a result of these new requirements. People living abroad, who may be serving or working for the government, may be forced to leave their beloved animal companions behind.

         "I OPPOSE the proposed ruling, “Control of Communicable Disease; Foreign Quarantine: Importation of Dogs and Cats.” \n \nI support the CDC’s intention to protect the United States against additional rabies cases, however I do not agree that hardening the rules on dog importation is the way to achieve this goal. According to the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases there are approximately 5,000 confirmed cases of rabies in animals in the United States and the vast majority are found in wildlife. Why harden the rules on dog importation, especially for responsible non-profits and individuals? \n \nNon-profit organizations in the United States and individuals go to extraordinary lengths to rescue dogs from wars and climate disasters around the world. We should not close our doors to this work but instead continue to make it safe and feasible for it to continue. In 2020 dogs accounted for just 1% (36) of all rabies cases in the US. In the past eight years, there have only been 4 cases of rabies from imported dogs. \n \nThe new proposed laws are unclear and an overstep. They burden nonprofit rescue organizations and private individuals with extreme costs and requirements that are nearly impossible to achieve for those working in war-torn countries like Ukraine. \n \nI strongly ask the agency to reconsider these proposed measures and refocus their efforts on rabies prevention to wildlife and livestock where regulations are truly needed to stop the disease in the United States. \n",

This ban does not make sense based on conversations with multiple veterinarians. The U.S. Government does not hesitate to move people to different locations overseas to better relations with foreign governments to protect the U.S., but yet they are not trusted to bring their faithful companions with them as it is possible their pets cannot reenter the United States. What do you expect people to do spend outside of their government salary and lose security clearances based on the expenses to ship a rabies test to a random location in countries far from where they are stationed or leave their pet behind? What is the U.S. saying to other countries? We care about our people only and too bad if there is and excessive pet population left behind because the people we sent to \"assist\" you cannot afford or are not allowed to bring their pets back to the United States once they finish their tour abroad. This is a terrible political statement you are making. You are damaging relationships with countries that the U.S. spends millions of dollars to assist each year. Why not spend the money training veterinarians in these countries verses putting a ban on importing peoples' pets. Good people who are willing to serve will no longer go to these countries to help serve the United States if the U.S. Government is turning its back on people who want to help, but yet love their pets.

Three days prior to the dog becoming ill, the dog had been part of a shipment of 33 dogs and one cat that had arrived in the US from Azerbaijan, one of the countries considered to be high-risk for canine variant rabies (https://www.cdc.gov/importation/bringing-an-animal-into-the-united-states/high-risk.html). \n",
       "\n",
       "There were nine states that were ultimately involved in the response to this case of imported canine rabies. In Pennsylvania, PADOH and PDA conducted extensive contact tracing of both the people and animals that could have been exposed to rabies from this dog. Ultimately, 14 Pennsylvania residents received rabies post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), and 10 dogs in Pennsylvania underwent post-serological monitoring (PSM) and were placed under quarantine orders. \n",
       "\n",
       "The dog had appeared healthy upon arrival and had all the necessary paperwork required for importation into the US. While previous imported cases of canine rabies were attributed to fraudulent vaccination records, this particular dog had indeed received the rabies vaccine prior to importation; unfortunately, when it was given, the vaccine was inadvertently underdosed. This meant that this dog did not receive adequate protection against rabies, which explains how it developed rabies. \n",
       "\n",
       "There had also been a delay in understanding the number and types of dogs that had been in the shipment from Azerbaijan to the United States. Requiring airlines to collect information on the importer, generate a bill of lading, and ensure that the animals will either be housed appropriately until they can be deemed healthy and rabies-free or returned to their country of origin will provide much needed safeguards to protect human and animal health. Providing a mechanism for state public health and state animal health agencies to be able to access that information from airlines in a timely manner will be vital as well.\n",
       "Additionally, this proposed rule-making update does not address cats. It is not unheard of for dogs and cats to be part of the same rescue shipment; that was certainly the case with the shipment from Azerbaijan. Extending these same requirements to cats from high-risk rabies countries would add an additional layer of protection against importation of canine-variant rabies in any species.\n",
       "\n",
       "Because Azerbaijan is high-risk, this importation would not have occurred had it taken place when the CDC’s temporary suspension of dogs entering the United States from high-risk rabies countries was in effect. This response was a significant undertaking for both agencies and required many resources, both from the people who were exposed and from the government as a whole; costs of rabies PEP can range from $1,200 to $6,500 per person, and CDC estimates that each rabid imported dog can cost the government up to $500,000 (Raybern C, Zaldivar A, Tubach S, et al. Rabies in a Dog Imported from Egypt — Kansas, 2019. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep 2020;69:1374–1377). All of those costs, however, pale in comparison to the cost of a person or pet dying from rabies.\n",
       "\n",
       "While other instances of imported rabid dogs have been attributed to fraudulent rabies vaccination certificates, it is worth noting that that was not the case here. A simple human error resulted in this dog and several others in the shipment not receiving the appropriate amount of rabies vaccine. Even if a well-intentioned and reputable organization works with a well-intentioned and reputable veterinary clinic to provide rabies vaccines, there is no way to definitively prevent human errors from happening with 100% certainty. The only thing that would have prevented this dog from putting Pennsylvania residents and animals at risk for dying from rabies would have been for the importation to not occur. The risk to public health and the cost of importing dogs from countries that are at high-risk for canine variant rabies is substantial. The Pennsylvania Department of Health and the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture are in favor of this order, support the continuation of this suspension, and look forward to working with CDC and other partners to refine these regulations in the future.</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file</td><td>3</td><td>1.0</td><td>CDC-2023-0051-0489</td><td>false</td><td>2023-08-18</td><td>Before</td></tr><tr><td>32</td><td>CDC-2023-0051-0490</td><td>CDC</td><td>CDC-2023-0051</td><td>llf-l68x-9woc</td><td>Public Submission</td><td>2023-08-18T04:00Z</td><td>false</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>Comment from Hayward, Michelle</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>false</td><td>CDC-2023-0051-0001</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>2023-08-17T04:00Z</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>1</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>Michelle</td><td>Hayward</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>Why has the CDC extended its ban on imported dogs until July 31st, 2024?\n",

It is easier to keep the pets at the last post in between tours, not just to limit flights, but also to limit overall change of time zone, climate, environment, and living conditions. Furthermore, it is difficult enough to transport animals from overseas following the federal procurement requirements, adding a requirement that limits airports to 20 locations may increase travel time for the pet and costs for the owners that are not reimbursable.  \n",

       "I understand the need to minimize the chances for reintroduction of rabies into the US population of dogs. However, the proposed change would have a significant impact on the dog fancy community. Members of the dog fancy community are involved the importation of puppies into the US from select litters of particular interest to them based on the genetics of the dog for sport of conformation events. These people typically import 1 or 2 puppies at a time and get them into homes that will see that they are raised well and prepared for their future activities. These puppies are rarely found to be rabid. \n",
       "\n",
       "Conversely, based on published reports, it seems that the importation of rabid animals occurs far more frequently in larger-scale importation activities, usually conducted by organizations involved in the retail rescue industry. They bring in larger numbers of dogs from poor situations in an effort to rescue and rehome the dogs. While their objectives may be admirable, their ability to screen appropriate animals seems to be poor. \n",

       "It seems that a more refined approach could better serve the dog community, as a whole. It would seem to make sense to institute any of the below:\n",

       "2. Allow the importation of no more than 2-5 animals of age 10 weeks to 6 months on any flight\n",

This new form will have broad and sweeping application (“This proposed requirement would apply to all imported dogs (including dogs arriving from DMRVV-free and DMRVV low-risk countries) arriving in the United States by air, land, or sea.”) It is imperative to share the contents of this form since it would apply to all dogs and all importers.

       "RE: arrival ports. \"For dogs that have been in a DMRVV high-risk country in the past six months, and were vaccinated in a foreign country, this NPRM proposes that the dog be required to arrive a U.S. airport with a CDC quarantine station and a CDC-registered Animal Care Facility.\" Only 5 airports in the entire United States currently have a CDC Animal Care Facility. It took 4 years to have this many. This is a significant issue. The current “Option B” ability for a personal pet owner to bring 1-2 dogs from a high-risk country through 18 airports with a CDC Dog Import Permit does not appear in the current FRN. Is Option B going to continue or be eliminated for personal pet owners? Are all foreign–vaccinated dogs from high risk countries going to be funneled through only 5 airports? To serve citizens across the country, including foreign service and military, CDC must open a solicitation to at least double the number of animal care facilities with better geographic distribution to avoid bottle necks and near-monopolies. Already some of these facilities command fees that are exorbitant for the required pick up, a USDA veterinarian exam and a rabies vaccination (as much as $1,600 per dog). In addition to titer test at $200-$300, airline crate at $100-$200, excess baggage fee of $500 to $750, this can push dog import costs well over $2,500 per dog which is a significant burden.\n",

       "RE: more signatures on RVMR. The current Rabies Vaccination and Microchip Record should continue as is, without the proposed vague requirement for an additional “certification” by a “government official”. This puts too much burden on pet owners to jump through unnecessary hoops. The RVMR is vouched for by the importer (whose contact information is provided) and by the licensed veterinarian (whose contact information is provided) and also by the required rabies titer which is from a CDC-approved lab and is certified by yet another veterinarian. The current requirements for RVMR plus titer should stand as-is without additional onerous and vague requirements as together these documents and certifying individuals ensure that the dog is not only properly vaccinated against rabies but has also demonstrated immune response. The CDC could take other more-targeted measures should issues arise in future such as maintaining a list of veterinarians who are ineligible to sign the RVMR for US import for a specified period. This more-targeted action will better ensure compliance by subjecting foreign veterinarians to losing customers should they lose the ability to sign a document for US import. For dogs who arrive without a rabies titer there is already the requirement for rabies re-vaccination plus a 28-day quarantine which obviates rabies risk (at a cost of $4,265 at the Ark at JFK for example). \n",
       "\n",
       "RE:  DVMRR-restricted countries. Again, why not utilize a more-targeted effort and create a list of specific foreign veterinarians who due to past problems are prohibited from signing off on US import paperwork? If a violation occurs (ie a fraudulent rabies certificate) then the issuing veterinarian as well as the importer can be notified (because the form already captures phone and email) and a list posted on the CDC website of veterinarians by country who have lost priviledges of issuing an RVMR. Utilizing economic forces would seem to be more efficient at eliminating fraud from this system. \n",

Waiting until six months would have precluded us from training him to our standards as well as giving him the opportunity to bond with our family while he was still young enough. </td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file</td><td>0</td><td>1.0</td><td>CDC-2023-0051-0509</td><td>false</td><td>2023-08-22</td><td>Before</td></tr><tr><td>52</td><td>CDC-2023-0051-0510</td><td>CDC</td><td>CDC-2023-0051</td><td>llm-iedn-w8k7</td><td>Public Submission</td><td>2023-08-22T04:00Z</td><td>false</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>Comment from McHenry, Sara</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>false</td><td>CDC-2023-0051-0001</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>2023-08-22T04:00Z</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>1</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>Sara</td><td>McHenry</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>From the detailed information provided on this new proposed rule, I understand the challenges dealing with the import of dogs that may be infected with rabies. I do feel it is important that in certain situations, dogs who live in the US should be allowed health exemptions with a letter from their veterinarian. All vaccines carry risks and very small, tea cup breeds have the very highest incidences of reactions. In addition to the health implications for a dog that has had reactions to a rabies vaccine, the risk of a very small / tea-cup dog contracting rabies while traveling is extremely low. A consideration for dogs who need to travel out of the US and home but need modifications to the requirements for health reasons should be given the option of a medical professional's letter of exemption. Health certificates and examinations prior to entering the US are prudent and would make sense for all dogs regardless of vaccination status. These exam requirements could take place multiple times, as in a few days before travel and then again on travel day in order to rule out illness or rabies infection entirely. Thank you for your consideration for dogs that may need special accommodation options.</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file</td><td>4</td><td>0.2654977734961318</td><td>CDC-2023-0051-0510</td><td>false</td><td>2023-08-22</td><td>Before</td></tr><tr><td>53</td><td>CDC-2023-0051-0511</td><td>CDC</td><td>CDC-2023-0051</td><td>llm-iypy-2nmz</td><td>Public Submission</td><td>2023-08-22T04:00Z</td><td>false</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>Comment from Anonymous</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>false</td><td>CDC-2023-0051-0001</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>2023-08-22T04:00Z</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>1</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>Anonymous</td><td>Anonymous</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>I do not support this proposed rule for several reasons.

As things stand, a growing number of U.S. flag airlines will not transport dogs in hold; the proposed change would only make this harder.  The import restrictions introduced in 2019 led many airlines to refuse to transport dogs into the U.S. - which nearly led to our U.S.-vaccinated dog being left behind when our family was ordered to evacuate Ethiopia in 2021.

When we tried to bring the same dog home from Ethiopia in 2021, Turkish Airlines refused to transport him or any other dogs out of Addis Ababa if the final destination was the U.S., because of concerns about the rabies import restrictions.

Logically, if foreign vaccine certificates aren’t going to be considered valid, regardless of endorsements or any other authentications, then there is no point whatsoever in requiring people to supply them for review by CDC/USDA/CBP. The odds of an animal with an acceptable titer result carrying rabies is roughly zero. If foreign vaccinations are so unacceptable, then just disregard them, require the titer, and re-vaccinate on arrival. Otherwise, accept the rabies certificate and titer and stop wasting everyone’s time re-vaccinating already vaccinated dogs at POE. \n",

Puppies, being imported to the US, one or two puppies at a time, who themselves have been raised with care in the homes of small breeders abroad are not the same situation as unknown, \"puppy mill\" and \"rescued\" street dogs/pariah dogs found internationally. Although the risk of disease through these unknown dogs is legitimate, it is entirely a separate circumstance from individual dogs whose health and pedigree are known to both the exporting party and the importing party. These new rules, if passed as they are, will require Americans looking to import dogs into their breeding program to pay the exporter for an additional three to four months of care for the puppy, miss out on valuable training and bonding time with the dog, and place those burdens on the exporting family. In turn, depending on the size of the dog, the importing process under the belly of the plane places undue stress on a still-young animal. That is, of course, if the exporting party lets the dog leave their country of origin at all: six months raising & loving & training a dog only to send them thousands of miles away is a tall ask, nevermind the burden of raising the dog for that long, when the dog could simply be sold domestically. All of these concerns, human though they may be, are just the immediate concerns that come to mind when faced with this potential reality. Long-term, in rare and emerging breeds within the United States (those breeds participating in AKC's Foundation Stock Service & Misc. Class, as well as rarer breeds who have full recognition), we will see a depletion of quality & the lack of access to \"new lines\" will prevent the population from safely growing within the US. The risks of freezing & collecting semen and importing are significant, as there is never a guarantee of pregnancy, and often the best decision we may make for our smaller breeding programs is the import of a puppy, and place our hopes on that dog's health and conformation maturing into what we hope for. There simply must be a way to establish a international health certificate in Europe based on the parents known vaccine status, the presence of disease within a country, and further the health assessment on the young dog(s) in question-- that will decrease the risk of disease, increase the standard that imported, rescued dogs are held to, and allow dogs to enter into this country without the importing party missing out on critical socialization time with their young dogs. These dogs may be bred, eventually, following breed specific health testing, but they are all ultimately pets who are quite loved, and these rules stand to benefit very few, if any, people or animals in particular and likely will have lasting negative implications on both rescue dog populations and those importing known, well-bred dogs of good pedigree & health</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file</td><td>0</td><td>1.0</td><td>CDC-2023-0051-0557</td><td>false</td><td>2023-08-28</td><td>After</td></tr><tr><td>100</td><td>CDC-2023-0051-0558</td><td>CDC</td><td>CDC-2023-0051</td><td>llu-gobl-rzey</td><td>Public Submission</td><td>2023-08-29T04:00Z</td><td>false</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>Comment from Villarroel , Lindsey </td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>false</td><td>CDC-2023-0051-0001</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>2023-08-28T04:00Z</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>1</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>Lindsey</td><td>Villarroel</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>Please exempt the US military and State Departments members who are serving the country overseas.

       " Because we love our animals dearly, we have been diligent and meticulous about ensuring that they are always current on ALL of their vaccinations and see that they have have regular health care screenings. Over the years, we have come to know many, many other American families serving overseas, whether with the Department of State, the U.S. Armed Forces, or another government agency, and have observed nothing less than the same level of commitment toward ensuring that their pets are always well cared for and current on their vaccinations.\n",

       "Anyone who has moved overseas with a beloved pet knows all too well the many metaphorical hoops we already need to jump through, which are extremely time intensive and costly, in order to ensure that we have the appropriate health care certifications and documentation in order to enter the countries to which we travel and also back to the U.S. upon our return. I fully support ensuring that our animals are protected against rabies and providing documentation to demonstrate that; however, the additional restrictions imposed upon government personnel and their families in order to move their pets back to the U.S. from the high-risk rabies countries add untold hardship and stress during the already very stressful process of relocating from a foreign country. I have personally witnessed many families scramble - even with advanced planning and preparation - to complete all of the currently necessary steps to ensure that they can re-enter the U.S. with their dogs, adding an additional layer of stress and anxiety to their PCS (permanent change of station) moves.\n",

       "Personally, my family very narrowly missed having to figure out how to bring our dog safely home from Ethiopia in 2021, when we had to evacuate due to civil unrest.   We were given only a day or two to pack up our belongings and complete all of the necessary steps required for a transition back to the U.S. from a diplomatic mission. Had the CDC’s dog importation suspension been in place at the time that we had to leave, we would have faced an impossible situation and the very real and heartbreaking prospect of having to leave our beloved pets behind. The thought of this makes me sick to my stomach... especially considering that we had just served nearly three years in a hostile country during the worst of the Covid pandemic. On many days, it was the comfort of our pets that got us through those challenging times.\n",
       "I respectfully ask that the CDC please consider very carefully the many negative effects that these proposed regulations will have on tens of thousands of government  personnel and their families who are serving the country overseas. While yes, we have chosen our careers and lifestyles of constant relocation, this does not mean that it is easy. We serve our country proudly and our pets provide an indescribable level of comfort and support while we are away from our families and friends back home. If these new regulations absolutely must go into effect, I propose an exemption for government personnel serving overseas in countries that are considered high risk for rabies. As mentioned above, I can understand and support requiring us to provide documentation of rabies vaccination, as has always been the case, but to add all of the additional layers of red tape in order simply to bring our furry family members home from the often challenging locations where we are serving on behalf the U.S. causes an enormous amount of stress and hardship during the already very difficult process of relocating internationally.\n",

This rule imposes undue difficulties on servicemembers and public servants, such as Department of State Foreign Service personnel, who are already assuming tremendous security, financial, and personal hardships to move their families abroad in support of U.S. national interests.  The HHS rule appears to be focused on “incomplete or fraudulent rabies vaccination certificates” and “criminal networks involved in the lucrative dog trade”.  Neither of these categories apply to public servants and military members.  These U.S. citizens understand the importance of full compliance with U.S. rules and regulations, particularly as they impact public health in the United States.  The majority of the dogs and cats traveling with these U.S. citizens were born in the United States and cared for by U.S. vets.  Those adopted by families overseas receive extensive treatment by foreign vets, in compliance with U.S. best practices for animal care.  By imposing such harsh restrictions on U.S. public servants and military personnel, the CDC is discounting the trust that the U.S. government already places in such personnel to best represent the interests of the United States, including the duty to keep the U.S. homeland safe from public health threats.  It is the height of irony that the U.S. government would spend hundreds of thousands of dollars vetting military servicemembers and public servants for high security clearances, only to turn around and say that they cannot be trusted to ensure their pets are properly vaccinated.  By forcing U.S. servicemembers and public servants to follow the proposed rules, HHS will be forcing these families to incur significant financial hardships and additional stress in altering travel arrangements under the guise of addressing a threat that simply does not exist among this demographic of traveler.  Families who cannot afford to shoulder this burden will be faced with the unthinkable decision of having to re-home pets that have become members of their family.  If we are asking servicemembers and public servants to assume risks by taking hardships assignments outside the United States, we must trust them to comply with existing U.S. regulations.  If this act is to go forward, it simply must have an exemption built in for personnel overseas on official U.S. government orders.\n",

I appreciate the opportunity to comment on CDC’s proposed rulemaking regarding the import of dogs and cats into the United States. The impetus of this law resulted from numerous cases of fraudulent import paperwork and the importation of dogs with rabies. The intent of this law is to prevent additional occurrences and protect public health by preventing the reintroduction and spread of dog-maintained rabies virus variant (DMRVV) in the United States. I understand the intent of the law and the concern for public health however I ask the CDC to consider and mitigate the unintended consequences of this proposed rule. As it stands, this proposed rule is detrimental to US government employees serving their country abroad who navigate the complicated animal health requirements of many countries as they move their companion animals with them. \n",
       "\n",
       "As I read the executive summary of the rule, I see ‘importation’ again and again. The CDC needs to better define what conditions they are considering when they are  talking about ‘importation’ and what activity they are trying to regulate. When US government personnel return to the US after being posted abroad, we are not ‘importing’ our dogs or cats. We are returning to the US with our family and our pets generally for a short period of time before we are sent to our next post. During this time, we seek the medical care we could not receive overseas, we attend to the needs of family that remained in the US, we take care of personnel and financial matters, and we receive training to prepare us for our next post. Categorizing our pets as imports, requiring them to enter only through certain ports, and mandating a quarantine period puts an undue burden on a group of public servants who already get enough of that with these emotionally, mentally, and physically demanding careers we have chosen for the public good. \n",
       "We follow the rules of animal transport, vaccination, and animal health all because we want the best for our pets and we want them to be able to move with us and will not risk their loss. We pose little threat to the DMRVV-free status of the US and are unlikely to be associated with fraudulent paperwork. I ask that the CDC grant an exception to the requirements in this proposed rule, either through the definition of import, acknowledgement of government and military personnel in the rule, or in some other manner. Moving away from a country of origin focused rule to an end use focused rule (sale/adoption versus companion animal) should also be considered. \n",
       "\n",
       "I understand that the CDC makes decisions in the interest of protecting public health and hope the CDC works to understand the situation of US government personnel and their companion animals, and reconsiders the extent and applicability of the proposed rule and makes an exception for US Government personnel. The CDC is basically exiling me from returning to the US until my dogs dies, so thanks for that. \n",
       "HHS/CDC also proposes to prohibit or otherwise restrict importation of dogs into the United States from certain countries that have a history of exporting dogs infected with DMRVV to other countries or have demonstrated a lack of appropriate veterinary controls to prevent the exportation of rabid dogs: An exception for US government personnel should be added here. We have no control over where we are posted and should not pay the price because we are serving our country abroad with our family which incudes our companion animals. It also doesn’t help that CDC has designated most countries as DMRVV high risk countries. \n",
       "Prior to traveling out of the United States, a USDA-Accredited Veterinarian would need to complete and sign a form titled “ Certification of U.S.-issued Rabies Vaccination for Live Dog Re-entry into the United States.” - Does this form exist – have you coordinated with USDA VS to create this form? What is your educational campaign to provide it to all of the accredited vets and make sure vet clinics know they need this? Also, what are you going to do for people like me who are already overseas? What if I don’t return for 5 more years? You are complicating an already complicating process by requiring yet another form. And expecting people to hold on to the form for the 2-4 years they are at post. Or even longer if we don’t come home between posts. \n",

In addition to duplicative requirements which seem to serve little purpose (for example, verification of the vaccination by titer test and re-vaccination even once the first vaccination has been verified) the lack of flexibility with which it has been implemented is remarkable.  The CDC has shown inflexibility at every step of the way, refusing to make things simpler for military and foreign service members who own pets and also not following the letter of their own rules.  Last time I returned to the US with a dog, I received an authorization which stated it was valid at any of the approved ports of entry.

She arrived in the US fully vetted and my local vet did a full work up on her at her first appointment. These dogs don’t represent a problem to the level that these restrictions cover. The restrictions will result in the deaths of a lot of animals that could have found caring homes there. Please reconsider this.

         "The proposed rule places unnecessary burden on dog owners living overseas. As a public health professional, I understand the importance of preventing the reintroduction of rabies to America, but as a US Diplomat, I am dismayed that CDC has established rules that are excessively onerous. \n\nAs a USAID Foreign Service Officer, most, if not all, countries that I may be assigned are on CDC's list of high risk countries, and do not have Approved Rabies Serology Laboratories. As a single woman, my dogs provide both companionship and security when living overseas in difficult places. While I will not bid on positions in countries where pets are not permitted, I am deeply concerned about these rules in the event of an unanticipated emergency leading to ordered departure from a post. This could be for a number of reasons from political instability, to an environmental emergency, with very little warning. In the event of an ordered departure, there would not be time (or possibly even in country systems) to obtain a serology test from abroad and get CDC importation approval (the recommended time according to CDC is 8 weeks). Abandoning my dogs or putting my dogs in a 28 day quarantine would be an additional burden in an already difficult time.\n\nAs a responsible dog owner, I ensure that my dog is up to date on all vaccines. While I understand that these rules are intended to prevent falsified documentation, I urge you to consider an exception for USG employees and service members serving abroad, or at a minimum exceptions for people serving at posts on ordered departure. \n\nI make sacrifices to serve my country in difficult posts overseas, and I accept a certain level of risk to do so, but I also expect my country to take care of my family unit, which includes my dogs ",

There are thousands of individuals that work for the U.S. Government, contractors for the government, and family members who are trusted to go work in locations outside of the U.S. to assist, protect and serve U.S. citizens while giving up the conveniences of the U.S. Yet, you are going to put a ban or charge money to officials and employees of the United States who make the sacrifice to serve their country. This ban does not make sense based on conversations with multiple veterinarians. The U.S. Government does not hesitate to move people to different locations overseas to better relations with foreign governments to protect the U.S., but yet they are not trusted to bring their faithful companions with them as it is possible their pets cannot reenter the United States. What do you expect people to do spend outside of their government salary and lose security clearances based on the expenses to ship a rabies test to a random location in countries far from where they are stationed or leave their pet behind? What is the U.S. saying to other countries? We care about our people only and too bad if there is and excessive pet population left behind because the people we sent to \"assist\" you cannot afford or are not allowed to bring their pets back to the United States once they finish their tour abroad. This is a terrible political statement you are making. You are damaging relationships with countries that the U.S. spends millions of dollars to assist each year. Why not spend the money training veterinarians in these countries verses putting a ban on importing peoples' pets. Good people who are willing to serve will no longer go to these countries to help serve the United States if the U.S. Government is turning its back on people who want to help, but yet love their pets. This proposed rule is a terrible decision by the CDC.",

The number of cases of communicable diseases being imported into a country is not such a large number as to consign so many countless humane, merciful cases to defeat or very often, death.

         "If such restrictions are implemented, they would have several potential implications for U.S. diplomats and their pets, similar to the U.S. military:\n\nImpact on morale, recruitment, and U.S. National Security: The U.S. government and foreign service agencies need skilled diplomats to represent the U.S. abroad. Policies that make it difficult for diplomats to bring their pets back home will affect morale and deter prospective diplomats from accepting overseas assignments, which in turn risks U.S. national security.\n\nHealth concerns are not mitigated by restricting U.S. diplomats' pets: U.S. diplomats' pets are always vaccinated against rabies and other diseases. While vaccinations are essential for public health and the safety of both humans and animals, import restrictions are unnecessary because diplomat's pets have vaccinations and pose minimal risk of disease transmission.\n\nEmotional stress: Diplomats and their families often experience significant emotional stress during overseas postings. Pets can provide valuable companionship and support during these challenging times. Forcing diplomats to leave their beloved pets behind due to import restrictions could add further emotional strain and make the transition back to the United States more difficult.\n\nLong separation periods: If import restrictions are in place, diplomats have to explore other options for rehoming their pets or temporarily leaving them in the host country. This could lead to extended periods of separation from their pets, which can be distressing for both the diplomats and the animals at significant personal cost.\n\nLimited options for bringing pets: U.S. diplomats often live in various countries around the world, and their assignments can last for several years. During their time abroad, diplomats maintain strong bonds with their pets and plan to bring them back to the United States when their assignment ends. If import restrictions are imposed, diplomats will find it more difficult to bring their pets home.\n\nI strongly encourage the CDC to consider the negative impact restrictions for U.S. diplomats would have on U.S. national security without improving public safety. Please, please make it easier for our diplomats to bring their pets back to the United States after serving the country overseas.",

         "Rabies is a preventable viral disease most often transmitted through the bite of a rabid animal. The rabies virus infects the central nervous system of mammals. Once symptoms start, rabies is essentially 100% fatal in all infected animals, including humans. Globally, most human deaths are attributed to canine variant rabies associated with dog bites; however, public policies like mandatory rabies vaccine requirements have eliminated canine variant rabies in the United States. The decades of work to eliminate canine variant rabies in the United States has also contributed to a steady decline of human rabies deaths nationally since the 1970’s. \n\nIn June 2021, the Pennsylvania Department of Health (PADOH) and the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture (PDA) were notified of a dog that tested positive for canine variant rabies. Three days prior to the dog becoming ill, the dog had been part of a shipment of 33 dogs and one cat that had arrived in the US from Azerbaijan, one of the countries considered to be high-risk for canine variant rabies (https://www.cdc.gov/importation/bringing-an-animal-into-the-united-states/high-risk.html). \n\nThere were nine states that were ultimately involved in the response to this case of imported canine rabies. In Pennsylvania, PADOH and PDA conducted extensive contact tracing of both the people and animals that could have been exposed to rabies from this dog. Ultimately, 14 Pennsylvania residents received rabies post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), and 10 dogs in Pennsylvania underwent post-serological monitoring (PSM) and were placed under quarantine orders. \n\nThe dog had appeared healthy upon arrival and had all the necessary paperwork required for importation into the US. While previous imported cases of canine rabies were attributed to fraudulent vaccination records, this particular dog had indeed received the rabies vaccine prior to importation; unfortunately, when it was given, the vaccine was inadvertently underdosed. This meant that this dog did not receive adequate protection against rabies, which explains how it developed rabies. \n\nThere had also been a delay in understanding the number and types of dogs that had been in the shipment from Azerbaijan to the United States. Requiring airlines to collect information on the importer, generate a bill of lading, and ensure that the animals will either be housed appropriately until they can be deemed healthy and rabies-free or returned to their country of origin will provide much needed safeguards to protect human and animal health. Providing a mechanism for state public health and state animal health agencies to be able to access that information from airlines in a timely manner will be vital as well.\nAdditionally, this proposed rule-making update does not address cats. It is not unheard of for dogs and cats to be part of the same rescue shipment; that was certainly the case with the shipment from Azerbaijan. Extending these same requirements to cats from high-risk rabies countries would add an additional layer of protection against importation of canine-variant rabies in any species.\n\nBecause Azerbaijan is high-risk, this importation would not have occurred had it taken place when the CDC’s temporary suspension of dogs entering the United States from high-risk rabies countries was in effect. This response was a significant undertaking for both agencies and required many resources, both from the people who were exposed and from the government as a whole; costs of rabies PEP can range from $1,200 to $6,500 per person, and CDC estimates that each rabid imported dog can cost the government up to $500,000 (Raybern C, Zaldivar A, Tubach S, et al. Rabies in a Dog Imported from Egypt — Kansas, 2019. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep 2020;69:1374–1377). All of those costs, however, pale in comparison to the cost of a person or pet dying from rabies.\n\nWhile other instances of imported rabid dogs have been attributed to fraudulent rabies vaccination certificates, it is worth noting that that was not the case here. A simple human error resulted in this dog and several others in the shipment not receiving the appropriate amount of rabies vaccine. Even if a well-intentioned and reputable organization works with a well-intentioned and reputable veterinary clinic to provide rabies vaccines, there is no way to definitively prevent human errors from happening with 100% certainty. The only thing that would have prevented this dog from putting Pennsylvania residents and animals at risk for dying from rabies would have been for the importation to not occur. The risk to public health and the cost of importing dogs from countries that are at high-risk for canine variant rabies is substantial. The Pennsylvania Department of Health and the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture are in favor of this order, support the continuation of this suspension, and look forward to working with CDC and other partners to refine these regulations in the future.",

         "Why has the CDC extended its ban on imported dogs until July 31st, 2024?\n\nAnother year of dogs stuck; unable to move on from reliable, responsible rescues who care for and vaccinate their dogs and want to see them happily settled in US homes.\n\nI can understand denying entry to those dogs that are unvaccinated and undocumented, but if they have all their paperwork and shots, they should not be denied entry.\n\nThis ban is causing an unbearable strain on overcrowded rescues in some of the poorest countries in the world. To get them ready for adoption takes a huge amount of resources, determination, and altruism to achieve. \nAnd yet it has been successfully achieved for years by thousands of rescue organizations and individuals! \n\nBecause of the ban, puppies are growing into adults in conditions that are not good for behavior, making them harder to retrain the longer they wait in limbo - and less attractive to potential adopters who often want puppies. \n\nThe costs of keeping dogs longer is also crippling these people as food and medical costs keep rising. We supporters can only donate so much! A space taken in a rescue for longer than necessary, is a safe space unavailable to other dogs enduring hardship, starvation, and cruelty on the streets.\n\nAdd to this the immense distress caused to people trying to move to the US with their personal dogs - including veterans - combined with a lack of CDC-approved labs, and the ban is unjustifiable.\n\nThe CDC should be more concerned about the terrible conditions within US factory farms, fur farms, and puppy mills that are virtually unregulated. They are far more likely to carry disease than vaccinated dogs sent by caring people from other countries. \n\nThe UK had a similar ban on dog imports for the same reasons as the CDC, lasting just 9 months. There is no reason for this ban to drag on another year.\n\nA blanket ban on one beloved species is not disease control. It is discrimination. We are not all puppy farmers and illegal importers.\n\nTo make it permanent would be unconscionable.\n\nPlease address what needs changing to make the system work, and let's keep saving lives. \n\n",

         "I appreciate the spirit of the proposed rule, however the manner in which it greatly affects U.S. government servants representing the interests of the United States abroad makes this blanket rule untenable. \n\nFor Foreign Service Officers and other federally employed staff working for U.S. government agencies abroad, this rule has dire consequences on the morale and quality of life for many officers. We are acutely aware and familiar with the importance of implementing U.S. Government rules and laws abroad. We frequently have high-level security clearances, granted on this basis of our integrity and honesty. \n\nThe data presented in the rule is not nuanced enough. This rule fails to account for or reference data regarding any U.S. Government employees' dogs that may have violated the USG's rules about valid rabies vaccinations. Therefore, given the strict rules and regulations USG employees are required to follow in all other aspects of their personal and professional lives while employed by the USG and residing abroad, I humbly request the CDC consider a waiver directly for employees of the U.S. Government. \n\nAnimals, especially dogs, are a vital part of our lives while abroad. They often provide comfort and familiarity for families when everything else in our lives frequently and rapidly changes (including changes that are not always in our control, such as being evacuated in the event of an emergency from a country). Rather than impose a blanket ban on the importation of all dogs from abroad, there has to be a better way to achieve this rule while recognizing the hardship this rule places on U.S. Government employees working abroad. \n\nRecognizing that the CDC does permit for import on the basis of titer tests is helpful, however the availability of said titer tests is often hard and unreliable abroad. Considering an exemption for U.S. Government employees who have documented proof of consistent rabies vaccines would be a much better option. Leaving our pets behind in a country, or not being able to bring them with us to a new assignment (as was the case with my dog) severely affects employee morale and creates a void in families that cannot be filled. I take my position representing the United States abroad extremely seriously. It is in the oath of office we sign when we first join the Foreign Service to \"protect and defend\" the United States. That includes against diseases such as rabies. The last thing any one of us wants to do is bring a potentially deadly virus into the U.S. That being said, I urge the CDC to consider a waiver for dogs imported by U.S. families, not just in rabies-free countries, but from all countries with documented proof of a rabies vaccine. Upon arrival to the U.S. it is much easier and feasible to get a titer test. If one is still required, perhaps and option would be to permit for the titer test to be performed in the U.S. within so many days of arrival and importation. ",

It was very stressful trying to make sure our dog had all the correct vaccinations and documentation before we left the U.S. last year (during what is already a very stressful transition time for the family), to ensure that we would have a smooth re-entry back into the U.S. in 2 years. Now, this NPRM is going to make it even more cumbersome for families with pets who are assigned to work abroad. I'm particularly opposed to requirement 7 which requires the family to have certified the rabies vaccination form titled \"Certification of U.S.-Issued Rabies Vaccination for Live Dog Re-Entry into the United States BEFORE the dog departed the U.S. This requirement is not fair to families who are already departed the U.S. with their dog before this rule was proposed.

         "While I understand the need for rabies control, the proposed regulation will have a negative impact on breeders, pet, and sport dog competitors who are seeking to import puppies.  It is already costly to import a puppy for sport or other purposes; this ruling will make it very substantially harder because very few foreign breeders would be willing to keep a puppy for 6 months, and if they are, the level of socialization they will provide is likely to be substantially less than a dedicated owner.  If imports are restricted, especially for dogs like Belgian shepherds/malinois, genetic bottlenecks and greater inbreeding will make these breeds more disease-prone — and we, including the USG, need our purpose-bred dogs to be healthy.\nWould it be possible to amend the proposed regulation to allow INDIVIDUALS only to import up to 2 dogs a year under age 6 months from rabies-free countries? \nThat would require a pre approval process but would meet most legitimate breeder/hobbyist/sport or other need.

         "The Drentsche Patrijshond Club of North America (DPCNA) is a Montana non-profit corporation dedicated to maintaining the Drentsche Patrijshond (Drent) as a field ready and family oriented versatile pointing dog in North America as the breed is kept in its homeland, the Netherlands.\n\nThe DPCNA opposes – in part - the proposed rulemaking as it would introduce an unduly restrictive importation process, detrimental for our breed, that fails to serve a demonstrated public health purpose. Drents are imported from European countries that have eradicated rabies: Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark and Sweden. The CDC neither requires nor proposes a rabies vaccination requirement for dogs coming from these countries. Nonetheless, the proposed rule-making would needlessly apply an age restriction, expressly tied to the need to verify rabies vaccination, to the importation of puppies from countries without a rabies vaccination requirement.\n\nThe DPCNA proposes that the exception to the age requirement provided to arrivals from Canada and Mexico should be extended on equal terms to other low-risk or DMRVV-free countries, which would also necessitate striking the land crossing requirement. This modest solution fully addresses the public health concerns outlined in the notice of proposed rulemaking. The solution has the added benefit of making the proposed rule internally consistent.\nThere is no commercial importation of Drents: United States citizens import individual Drent puppies based on a personal relationship with a European breeder. Drent puppies mostly come from the Netherlands, but also Belgium, Denmark and Sweden. Each of these countries is not only free of canine rabies, but – unlike the United States – completely rabies free.1 Documentation accompanying puppies establishes their age and vaccination status as well as ownership by the citizen returning home with the puppy. Traveling at eight weeks of age, consistent with USDA requirements, a puppy travels in the passenger cabin with its owner and not as unattended cargo.\n\nUnless modified, the proposed rule would create insurmountable and unnecessary barriers to the success of the Drent in the United States. The Drent is a rare breed. The North American population is small and largely comprised of dogs imported as puppies and the immediate offspring of these dogs. Genetic diversity is limited in the current population. The breed in North America will not thrive and may not survive without the infusion of diverse genetics through the further importation of Drent puppies from rabies-free countries.\n\nThere is no public health justification for applying the proposed six-month age requirement to puppies coming from rabies-free countries. The age requirement is an overbroad, inconsistently applied, and misguided animal welfare provision, at least where older dogs may enter the United States without proof of rabies vaccination. The age provision may have merit for dogs coming from high-risk countries where CDC requires vaccination for rabies that is not possible in young puppies. But it has no applicability where no vaccination requirement currently exists or is proposed.\n\nProposed Solution: The exception to the age requirement provided to arrivals from Canada and Mexico should be extended on equal terms to other low-risk or DMRVV-free countries, which would also necessitate striking the land crossing requirement.",

         "Public Comment on CDC’s Dog and Cat Importation Regulation (42 CFR 71.50 and 71.51) Docket Number (CDC-2023-0051) or the RIN (0920-AA82) \n\nAfter reviewing the CDC-2023-0051-0 I understand that CDC documented more than 1,000 instances of incomplete, inadequate, or fraudulent rabies vaccination certificates for dogs arriving from dog-maintained virus variant (DMRVV) high-risk countries between January 2020 and July 2021 (p. 128)1. I also understand that each affected dog may infect 26 other animals during transport and the labor hours associated with each of these cases1. However, from the CDC’s rabies records, almost all of domestic animal rabies infections are from interactions with wildlife, namely bats. Similarly, nearly all human rabies infections stem from bats as well, as CDC-2023-0051-0 reported, “... no U.S. resident has died after exposure to an imported dog with DMRVV in at least 20 years.” 1 \n\nRegarding the domestic animals infected with rabies, outdoor pets and strays are most likely the problem.2 The number of strays and domestic pets with rabies correlate by state. For instance, Texas led in both number of euthanized domestic animals (which due to lack of required reporting, one can assume represents strays or abandoned animals) and rabies infected dogs in 2018.2,3   \n\nIt is infeasible to transport dogs internationally for American vaccines issued by American vets. Not all military and Foreign Service posts have American vets. The current rule does not accept rabies vaccines from other sources, but returning pets to the US in between overseas tours increases trauma and stress to the pets and the owners. It is easier to keep the pets at the last post in between tours, not just to limit flights, but also to limit overall change of time zone, climate, environment, and living conditions. Furthermore, it is difficult enough to transport animals from overseas following the federal procurement requirements, adding a requirement that limits airports to 20 locations may increase travel time for the pet and costs for the owners that are not reimbursable.  \n\nCDC should focus on responsible animal breeding, ownership (proper vaccination and no “unattended”/”outdoor” pets), stray/adoption reporting, and import of newly acquired international animal requirements rather than punishing Foreign and Military Service members who take their furry family members with them from the US. Finally, based on the numbers, Texas is more of a problem than international imports.  \n\nResources: \n\n1 CDC’s Dog and Cat Importation Regulation (42 CFR 71.50 and 71.51) Docket Number (CDC-2023-0051) or the RIN (0920-AA82) available at: https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/07/10/2023-14343/control-of-communicable-diseases-foreign-quarantine-importation-of-dogs-and-cats \n\n2 CDC 2018.

         "To Whom It May Concern:\n\nI understand the need to minimize the chances for reintroduction of rabies into the US population of dogs. However, the proposed change would have a significant impact on the dog fancy community. Members of the dog fancy community are involved the importation of puppies into the US from select litters of particular interest to them based on the genetics of the dog for sport of conformation events. These people typically import 1 or 2 puppies at a time and get them into homes that will see that they are raised well and prepared for their future activities. These puppies are rarely found to be rabid. \n\nConversely, based on published reports, it seems that the importation of rabid animals occurs far more frequently in larger-scale importation activities, usually conducted by organizations involved in the retail rescue industry. They bring in larger numbers of dogs from poor situations in an effort to rescue and rehome the dogs. While their objectives may be admirable, their ability to screen appropriate animals seems to be poor. \n\nIt seems that a more refined approach could better serve the dog community, as a whole. It would seem to make sense to institute any of the below:\n1. Allow the importation of no more than 2-5 animals of all ages from a single shipper on any flight\n2. Allow the importation of no more than 2-5 animals of age 10 weeks to 6 months on any flight\n3. Allow individual owners/organization to import no more than 2-5 animals of age 10 weeks to 6 months in any 1-year period\n\nI believe that that a more nuanced approach provides a better solution for all dog owners, both those importing dogs as well as those in the US who will never import a dog and want to make sure that rabies is NOT reintroduced into the US dog population.",

         "RE:  new requirement for all dogs to be microchipped. This is a positive, common sense and relatively inexpensive means of ensuring that dogs have a unique identifier and helps to ensure that veterinary documents match the dog imported. Yes, let’s do this! \n\nRE:  new required form is proposed. The FRN references the “CDC Import Submission Form” - yet the form is not available for review. This new form will have broad and sweeping application (“This proposed requirement would apply to all imported dogs (including dogs arriving from DMRVV-free and DMRVV low-risk countries) arriving in the United States by air, land, or sea.”) It is imperative to share the contents of this form since it would apply to all dogs and all importers. New rule making should not proceed until this form is made public. \n\nRE: arrival ports. \"For dogs that have been in a DMRVV high-risk country in the past six months, and were vaccinated in a foreign country, this NPRM proposes that the dog be required to arrive a U.S. airport with a CDC quarantine station and a CDC-registered Animal Care Facility.\" Only 5 airports in the entire United States currently have a CDC Animal Care Facility. It took 4 years to have this many. This is a significant issue. The current “Option B” ability for a personal pet owner to bring 1-2 dogs from a high-risk country through 18 airports with a CDC Dog Import Permit does not appear in the current FRN. Is Option B going to continue or be eliminated for personal pet owners? Are all foreign–vaccinated dogs from high risk countries going to be funneled through only 5 airports? To serve citizens across the country, including foreign service and military, CDC must open a solicitation to at least double the number of animal care facilities with better geographic distribution to avoid bottle necks and near-monopolies. Already some of these facilities command fees that are exorbitant for the required pick up, a USDA veterinarian exam and a rabies vaccination (as much as $1,600 per dog). In addition to titer test at $200-$300, airline crate at $100-$200, excess baggage fee of $500 to $750, this can push dog import costs well over $2,500 per dog which is a significant burden.\n\nRE: more signatures on RVMR. The current Rabies Vaccination and Microchip Record should continue as is, without the proposed vague requirement for an additional “certification” by a “government official”. This puts too much burden on pet owners to jump through unnecessary hoops. The RVMR is vouched for by the importer (whose contact information is provided) and by the licensed veterinarian (whose contact information is provided) and also by the required rabies titer which is from a CDC-approved lab and is certified by yet another veterinarian. The current requirements for RVMR plus titer should stand as-is without additional onerous and vague requirements as together these documents and certifying individuals ensure that the dog is not only properly vaccinated against rabies but has also demonstrated immune response. The CDC could take other more-targeted measures should issues arise in future such as maintaining a list of veterinarians who are ineligible to sign the RVMR for US import for a specified period. This more-targeted action will better ensure compliance by subjecting foreign veterinarians to losing customers should they lose the ability to sign a document for US import. For dogs who arrive without a rabies titer there is already the requirement for rabies re-vaccination plus a 28-day quarantine which obviates rabies risk (at a cost of $4,265 at the Ark at JFK for example). \n\nRE:  DVMRR-restricted countries. Again, why not utilize a more-targeted effort and create a list of specific foreign veterinarians who due to past problems are prohibited from signing off on US import paperwork? If a violation occurs (ie a fraudulent rabies certificate) then the issuing veterinarian as well as the importer can be notified (because the form already captures phone and email) and a list posted on the CDC website of veterinarians by country who have lost priviledges of issuing an RVMR. Utilizing economic forces would seem to be more efficient at eliminating fraud from this system. \n\nThank you for your consideration. \n",

         "I understand the need for strict guidelines to prevent rabies from entering the United States, but they need to be adjusted to high risk animals from high risk countries. You have punished those of us that have our personal pets that are vaccinated properly in the US for rabies and still forcing us to go to specific airports to enter the country. I travel back and forth between Las Vegas and South America and my dog travels with me. My dog is vaccinated for rabies in the United States but I am still being forced to pay more and take longer flights with multiple stopovers because of your rule. I could always fly from South America directly to Las Vegas and now I'm not able to. My dog is vaccinated in the US and I have all the proper CDC paperwork filled out by my vet so why am I being forced to enter the US through one of only 18 listed airports by the CDC? If my dog is not high risk and I have the proper paperwork, I should be able to enter the country through any airport. You are penalizing those of us that do take this matter seriously and make sure we have the proper paperwork and the vaccinations from the US. I'm now forced to fly to LAX and go through customs and the dog check there. Then I have to book a separate flight and pay another $100 for my dog on that flight as opposed to having just one charge for my complete flight, I have two! This also lengthens my trip which forces my dog to have to remain in the carrier longer. My flight from LAX to Las Vegas is $44 for me on Southwest and I have to pay $100 for my dog under the seat because of your rule. They charge my dog more than twice what they charge me. Traveling with a pet is stressful enough without having these extra hurdles placed in front of us forcing us to extend our travel time and pay extra for our travel. I understand the need for these rules from high risk countries but dogs that are vaccinated in the US with the proper paperwork from their vet from the CDC should be enough for us to fly into the country through any airport! You need to be thinking of us, US citizens who also travel but have their pets with them that are properly vaccinated. We should not be penalized for what other countries are doing or breeders or any of those things. I have had my dog for 7 years and she is vaccinated in the US and she should be able to enter the US through any airport like she did for her first five years of her life. These last couple years have been hell because of this rule and very unfair to properly vaccinated dogs. Keep your other rules in place but you need to allow us to fly into any airport with a properly US vaccinated dog! I really hope someone is reading this and realizing that this makes much more sense. You can't have blanket rules that apply the same to properly vaccinated animals and those that are not! Please amend this rule for us vaccinated pets to be able to enter through any international airport in the US! Thank you.",

         "I understand the need for strict guidelines to prevent rabies from entering the United States, but they need to be adjusted to high risk animals from high risk countries. You have punished those of us that have our personal pets that are vaccinated properly in the US for rabies and still forcing us to go to specific airports to enter the country. I travel back and forth between Las Vegas and South America and my dog travels with me. My dog is vaccinated for rabies in the United States but I am still being forced to pay more and take longer flights with multiple stopovers because of your rule. I could always fly from South America directly to Las Vegas and now I'm not able to. My dog is vaccinated in the US and I have all the proper CDC paperwork filled out by my vet so why am I being forced to enter the US through one of only 18 listed airports by the CDC? If my dog is not high risk and I have the proper paperwork, I should be able to enter the country through any airport. You are penalizing those of us that do take this matter seriously and make sure we have the proper paperwork and the vaccinations from the US. I'm now forced to fly to LAX and go through customs and the dog check there. Then I have to book a separate flight and pay another $100 for my dog on that flight as opposed to having just one charge for my complete flight, I have two! This also lengthens my trip which forces my dog to have to remain in the carrier longer. My flight from LAX to Las Vegas is $44 for me on Southwest and I have to pay $100 for my dog under the seat because of your rule. They charge my dog more than twice what they charge me. Traveling with a pet is stressful enough without having these extra hurdles placed in front of us forcing us to extend our travel time and pay extra for our travel. I understand the need for these rules from high risk countries but dogs that are vaccinated in the US with the proper paperwork from their vet from the CDC should be enough for us to fly into the country through any airport! You need to be thinking of us, US citizens who also travel but have their pets with them that are properly vaccinated. We should not be penalized for what other countries are doing or breeders or any of those things. I have had my dog for 7 years and she is vaccinated in the US and she should be able to enter the US through any airport like she did for her first five years of her life. These last couple years have been hell because of this rule and very unfair to properly vaccinated dogs. Keep your other rules in place but you need to allow us to fly into any airport with a properly US vaccinated dog! I really hope someone is reading this and realizing that this makes much more sense. You can't have blanket rules that apply the same to properly vaccinated animals and those that are not! Please amend this rule for us vaccinated pets to be able to enter through any international airport in the US! Thank you.",

         "I would like to propose that alternative options be developed for frequent travelers such as those of us who work for the government or a company that require overseas stays of a year or more (but less than four years).\n\nIn these situations, many of our pets have spent considerable time in the United States (often born there) and have been vaccinated for years by U.S. veterinarians before going overseas.  With our frequent travel, these regulations are having an extremely negative impact on us/our pets.\n\nIn my case, I have two dogs. One, Raja, born in Morocco in 2014 (adopted by me that same year) and the other (Kai) born in the U.S. in 2016 (adopted in 2017). I brought Raja to the U.S. in 2015 where she was again vaccinated yearly for rabies. Kai was as well. We lived in Washington DC for four years and then traveled to South Africa in late 2019 and stayed there for three years with all of their vaccinations up to date.  We went through the CDC permit process to return from South Africa to the United States in July 2022.  We then left for India in September 2022.  My dogs will return to the United States permanently in November of this year.  They were vaccinated again in July 2022 in the United States (one year vaccination as they were not able to get the three year one because they had already been vaccinated again in South Africa (per U.S. regulations) before coming to the U.S.).\n\nI revaccinated the dogs in August of 2023 as we will return to the U.S. in November.  Returning to the U.S., I now have to complete all of the CDC import procedures again and my dogs have to have their blood drawn again, lips pulled back for the teeth photos etc. My return may be delayed if their test results are not received in time. It would be helpful if at least the same time deadlines (waiting three months for the titer etc) were not imposed each trip.  Also would be helpful if, once we have completed a permit request, we would simply need to update the request with proof of current vaccinations etc.\n\n",

         "From the detailed information provided on this new proposed rule, I understand the challenges dealing with the import of dogs that may be infected with rabies. I do feel it is important that in certain situations, dogs who live in the US should be allowed health exemptions with a letter from their veterinarian. All vaccines carry risks and very small, tea cup breeds have the very highest incidences of reactions. In addition to the health implications for a dog that has had reactions to a rabies vaccine, the risk of a very small / tea-cup dog contracting rabies while traveling is extremely low. A consideration for dogs who need to travel out of the US and home but need modifications to the requirements for health reasons should be given the option of a medical professional's letter of exemption. Health certificates and examinations prior to entering the US are prudent and would make sense for all dogs regardless of vaccination status. These exam requirements could take place multiple times, as in a few days before travel and then again on travel day in order to rule out illness or rabies infection entirely. Thank you for your consideration for dogs that may need special accommodation options.",

         "I do not support this proposed rule for several reasons. This regulation will have a big impact on purebred dog populations in the United States, which I am a proud owner and member of. \n\nFirst, certain breeds that originated in Europe require dogs from European breeders to help expand our US breeding pool. It will be very difficult to find breeders that are willing to keep a puppy until 6 months of age due to the puppy forming bonds with the breeder and their existing dogs. This will have a detrimental effect on purebred breeding programs in the U.S.\n\nSecond, the 6 months age requirement should be made exempt for puppies coming from low risk or rabies-free countries. \n\nThird, it is very important for breeders and breed enthusiasts of purebred dogs to be able to import puppies under the age of 6 months in order for them to being forming a bond with their new families and start training. Certain training windows happen earlier than 6 months, such as socialization and desensitization periods. ",

         "The 6-month age requirement for puppies from rabies-free or low-risk countries overlooks the fact that many importers source from ethical, reputable breeders aiming to advance U.S. breeding programs. Holding puppies until they reach six months can hinder purebred initiatives, particularly for rare breeds, due to the bond formed between the puppy and its first home, potentially posing challenges for breeders abroad. Furthermore, the initial months of a puppy's life are crucial for training, socialization, and desensitization—particularly if they are destined for competitions or work. Denying enthusiasts the ability to import younger puppies could undermine training and the formation of essential early bonds.",

         "Exemption of the 6 months age requirement for puppies coming from rabies-free or low-risk countries. \nIndividuals importing puppies from rabies-free or low-risk countries are purchasing their puppies from well known, ethical breeders, typically in an attempt to help further their breeding program here in the United States. It would be difficult to find breeders who are willing to keep a puppy until 6 months of age due to the puppy forming bonds with the breeder and their existing dogs. This could cripple purebred breeding programs of rare breeds in the United States.  \nIt's important that breeders and enthusiasts of purebred dogs are able to import puppies under the age of 6 months. This young age is critical for owners to begin forming a bond with their puppy. Training begins prior to 6 months of age, not having the ability to obtain a puppy younger than 6 months would be detrimental to training wanted behavior and beginning skills of the puppy. These early months are also paramount for socializing and desensitizing a puppy that will be competing or working.  ",

The first few months of a puppy’s life are also so important. It’s beneficial if they can spend time prior to 6 months in their new homes and most reputable breeders won’t send a dog home at the age.

When they started the process to return to the US, they had only a 2 week window to get their dog home otherwise he would have ended up in an foreign SPCA and probably euthanized.  Most foreign countries do not treat animals kindly or are already animal overpopulated.  Preventing these beloved animals to return to the US is utterly heartbreaking for the owner as well as the pet not to mention the children involved.  There needs to be a better solution than banning the return of the animal outright, especially if the owner can prove the animal is fully vaccinated and free from disease.

         "The 6-month age requirement for puppies from rabies-free or low-risk countries overlooks the fact that many importers source from ethical, reputable breeders aiming to advance U.S. breeding programs. Holding puppies until they reach six months can hinder purebred initiatives, particularly for rare breeds, due to the bond formed between the puppy and its first home, potentially posing challenges for breeders abroad. Furthermore, the initial months of a puppy's life are crucial for training, socialization, and desensitization—particularly if they are destined for competitions or work. Denying enthusiasts the ability to import younger puppies could undermine training and the formation of essential early bonds.",

         "Many animal protection organizations, including the Humane Society of the United States and Humane Society International, respond to cruelty and disasters at the request of local communities across the world, and I believe that we should safeguard the capacity of such organizations to transport unowned dogs safely out of these disaster areas and into the United States for adoption. While I support the intention behind this action—it is critical to protect animals and families in the United States from rabies—the proposed rule poses significant burdens on rescue organizations and people traveling with their pets. \n\nThe proposed rule goes far beyond the temporary dog import rule by imposing import requirements on all dogs imported into the United States, regardless of country of origin. The proposed rule does not distinguish between personal and commercially imported dogs, requiring all dogs to be at least 6 months old, bear a microchip and submit a CDC import form prior to travel. Extending these requirements to all dogs will greatly burden the CDC, and I want to express concern over the agency’s ability to handle this dramatically increased regulatory volume. \n\nNotably, the proposed rule asks all importers to prove a negative, that their dog has NOT been in a high-risk rabies country for six months before arriving in the U.S, without providing guidance on how an importer would do so. The severity of being denied admission, and required to return within 72 hours of arrival, is a grave burden for dogs and those trying to help them. Hinging this on a vague, and in many cases impossible, requirement means that many animals who otherwise would have been transported from countries with low or no rabies risk will not be able to be rescued and that even owners travelling with their own pets will be at risk of being denied entry if they don’t provide the proper “proof.”\n\nI appreciate that the proposed rule advocates for airlines to provide safe housing for quarantined dogs and increased transparency around determining cause of death for dogs in their care. I thank the agency for its work, and respectfully request that the agency provide clear instructions for all importers on how to demonstrate that their dogs have not been in a high-risk rabies country for six months before arriving in the U.S. I also ask that the agency reconsider requiring CDC import submission forms for all imported dogs to avoid unnecessary regulatory delay and agency burden.",

         "The impact of Brucellosis on the import of dogs from countries with a high prevalence is a crucial concern that demands our attention. Brucellosis is a highly contagious bacterial infection that can spread among dogs and humans, posing a significant public health risk. To mitigate this risk, it becomes imperative to implement strict measures to prevent the spread of this disease by importing dogs.\n\nOne effective strategy is to focus on importing dogs at a young age, ideally under six months. This approach is rooted in sound reasoning. Dogs under six months of age are less likely to have engaged in sexual activity, reducing the chances of them being carriers of sexually transmitted infections like Brucellosis. This preventive measure addresses a key factor in the transmission of the disease, thereby safeguarding both the imported dogs and the local dog population.\n\nImporting dogs over six months of age, especially those that have not been spayed or neutered, creates a potential challenge. Unaltered street dogs, prevalent in some regions, tend to become sexually active around this age. This increases the risk of Brucellosis transmission through sexual activity. By focusing on importing younger dogs, we minimize this risk and create a healthier foundation for them to adapt to their new homes while reducing the potential for disease transmission.\n\nWith the potential ruling of import restrictions from countries like Mexico to dogs over the age of 6 months, we may be increasing the chance of importing Brucellosis into the US. I therefore ask that we strike this ruling from the proposed rule. ",

These changes will make it harder for dog rescue organizations to do their important work, they will make it harder for people to travel abroad with their pets, and they will complicate the lives of Americans who have been living abroad and wish to return home with dogs.

It also burdens the federal agencies that maintain a presence overseas because these draconian CDC restrictions make it even more difficult to staff already hard-to-fill positions in hardship posts. CDC dog import restrictions have been a continuous topic of conversation in federal employee fora as a central factor in employees’ decisions to a) refuse to take positions in the countries on the CDC’s banned list; b) resign from federal service entirely; and c) discourage others from seeking employment with federal agencies that maintain an overseas presence. Of the incidences of fraud that the CDC has documented, 0% involved U.S. federal government employees. These faithful servants of the American people should not be punished because of the actions of unscrupulous “animal rescue” organizations. Any permanent rule should have a narrow application to people and organizations that are actually causing problems. At a minimum, there should be exemptions for federal employees traveling on official orders.",

         "To whom it may concern,\n\nIt has come to my attention that the CDC is proposing a change to the regulation regarding import of foreign dogs (https://www.regulations.gov/document/CDC-2023-0051-0001). I want to voice my concern about the proposed changes and express that I am NOT in favor of the regulations as written. \n\nThe proposed regulations would substantially hinder responsible breeders' ability to introduce new lineage into the dog population. In order to ensure the health of our canine companions, and prevent inbreeding, new puppies often need to be acquired from overseas, and waiting until these puppies are 6 months of age would pose a stumbling block for these breeders.\n\nAdditionally, besides breeders, it is critical for dog enthusiasts to be able to start bonding, training, and socialization with their animal prior to 6 months. Those critical early months are crucial for ensuring well-behaved dogs - whether they are going to be working, competing, or simply companions.\n\nMy proposed change would be to adjust the language so that individuals may import dogs younger than 6 months from rabies-free, low-risk countries.\n\nThank you so much for your time and attention.\nCharlotte Wyman",

As the world continues to shrink in terms of global travel and movement, we are faced with dealing with potential disease vectors from other places.\n\nThis is, of course, is not a new problem; but it is something begging for immediate attention. I am reminded of a book by E. Fuller Torrey, MD and Robert H. Yolken, MD titled: Beasts of the Earth: Animals, Humans and Disease. \n\nhttps://www.rutgersuniversitypress.org/beasts-of-the-earth/9780813571430\n\nAnd while I can understand the desire of people to bring their beloved pets with them when they move, the U.S. needs more stringent rules on the transporting of animals into the country. \n\nMost especially, the US needs to look at all the animal rescues working to bring strays and other abandoned dogs from foreign countries into the U.S. I think we can all agree there are enough animals here needing homes; rescues should not be allowed to ship animals into the US from overseas.\n\nThank you for your time and attention to this important matter.",

         "I understand the CDC concern, but there are 119 countries designated as \"high risk\" for rabies.  I am in Ecuador, and noone in the GoE can tell me their statistics on rabies.  So how does CDC know that Ecuador is a high risk country?  Also, diplomats need to be exempt from this requirement if they are just transporting their family dogs back to the US.  I am going through the process right now, and just to get my Chihuahua into compliance is costing over $1,000.  Thankfully, the State Department has included allowances to enable me to get reimbursed, but this is an unnecessary burden to my family and unnecessary cost to the taxpayer.  We had to send our titer test sample to the Kansas State University because there are no other CDC-approved facilities here in Ecuador.  Also, the GoE has a very extensive and thorough process to EXPORT dogs from here which includes many of the same requirements that the CDC has imposed.  Seems redundant.",

He is part of our family and leaving him behind once our tour is over is not an option for us. Under the current CDC guidelines, we are already concerned about navigating the process to bring him back to the United States with us and know it will require extension financial resources and time to make happen (many of our friends have gone through the painful process). The new CDC guidelines will make the process even more difficult and I worry impossible for us to navigate. This places a huge burden on foreign services officers who are required to live abroad as part of our jobs and in service to the country to meet U.S. needs abroad. We sacrifice a lot to be here and asking us to sacrifice traveling with our pets I think is too high of an ask. I ask that the CDC consider an exemption or alternate process for U.S. foreign service officers. Thank you for your consideration. ",

I am deeply concerned that these proposed changes will impose even greater challenges for our family we return home with with our dog.\n\nMoving \"River\", our sweet golden retriever, around between my work assignments in Uzbekistan and India is already incredibly confusing, difficult, and expensive. My 6 kids would be devastated to not have their dog, as we establish a new home moving around every 2 year.

The proposed rule would cause severe hardship for my family, which is currently posted to Vietnam. Our dog spends his entire life here on a secure compound, with little contact with other dogs, all of whom are also fully vaccinated and regularly examined by a veterenarian. However, the proposed rule would require certification by two foreign vets, an expensive titer test (which we would have to obtain, at our own expense, from a lab in a third country) and would apparently eliminate his ability to return to the United States on the same flight as us at the end of our assignments. We are public servants, far from our friends and family at home, and our dog is a vital support to our small children as they navigate life in a foreign country. I urge the CDC to make an exception for members of the Foreign Service and the military, who already face so many challenges bringing our beloved pets with us as we serve the American people in difficult situations.",

         "I am writing to request an exemption to this rule for U.S. government employees overseas (both Military and Foreign Service of all federal agencies). \n\nI am a Foreign Service Officer (FSO) serving the people of the United States abroad. When I swore my oath to the U.S. Constitution, I also promised to serve wherever my country needs me. That includes in the less developed part of the world--which make up the vast majority of our overseas posts. I am also a parent with a small child and a dog who is his constant companion. When my family is moved from post to post, our dog moves as well. These moves include lengthy stops in the United States. (This is not optional as by Congressional order all FSOs must spend a period of \"Home Leave\" in the U.S., and most professional training is done in Washington.) \n\nI cannot tell you how hard it already is to move a family and a dog from country to country. The process is already complex and expensive, and the sheer number of medical documents required mean our dogs often get better healthcare overseas than us humans do. (The airlines alone make it almost impossible, but even they have an exemption for Military and Foreign Service moves.) However, we do it because our pets are one of the view sources of stability and constancy in our constantly transitory lives. We don't have the privilege to put down roots in any one community, so we have to invest that love and energy into what we can take with us.\n\nThe Foreign Service and Military communities are not the ones who are flaunting the rules and regulations for pet importation. By our very nature we are bureaucrats and rule-followers. We take care of our pets and keep them healthy. When we travel with them, we spend an inordinate amount of uncompensated time making sense of the rules and executing them. \n\nHowever, the new rules seem like we're set up to fail. \n\nIf our dogs got a rabies vaccine in the U.S. before deployment, many of our overseas tours longer than the period of efficacy. They of course get boosters overseas, but these boosters would be considered as having the same statutory validity. Given also that most FSOs transfer in the summer months, there is a real risk that the designated labs for titter tests will be overwhelmed and unable to process results in time.\n\nThe biggest problem however is the 5 designated airports as ports of entry. When traveling on government orders, as we do when we depart/return to the U.S. for our assignments, we DO NOT get to choose our flights or our route. These are determined by a separate agreement between the air carriers and the Federal government to establish a \"city pair\" rate, that all official travel must use. There are rare exceptions to this, but pet transport is not one of them. \n\nThe findings in this document name cases of rabies dog importation in recent years, all of which are from agents shipping dogs \"for adoption.\" None are from U.S. citizens trying to bring their dogs home.\n\nThe fight against rabies is a laudable one given the real public health risks. However, please do not punish the law-abiding civil and military personnel, and most importantly their families. Please grant an exception for those traveling on government orders. We willingly sacrifice a lot in service to our country, at least let us keep our corgi. ",

         "While I understand the concerns of the CDC regarding fraudulent rabies vaccine reports and the concern for the general safety of pets imported from \"high-risk\" countries, the process for importing pets is becoming far too difficult for those of us serving our country overseas at diplomatic and military posts worldwide. As a State Department Foreign Service family, our two dogs are integral members of our clan and make our lives so much fuller. Moving from country to country every 2 or 3 years has a very stressful impact on our children, but having their beloved pets means having a continuous friend wherever we land. We love them as if they were our children and the thought of not being able to bring them home with us upon returning to the US is unbearable and would devastate our family! \n\nWith the recent CDC ban on pets entering the U.S., many U.S. airlines have already taken licenses to reduce their liability by refusing to fly pets at all, which has been particularly challenging for those of us forced to travel using the \"Fly America Act\". Between heat embargos and the ban, it is becoming nearly impossible to keep our families together.  A typical foreign service spouse or officer has to spend dozens of hours arranging for a multitude of veterinary tests, phone calls to airlines to secure reservations, hiring pet shippers, and praying for success in getting their pets to their onward assignment. It takes away from our work and adds tremendous stress to an already tumultuous period in our lives.\n\nI think that you'll find that the average foreign service family is spending thousands of dollars to move their furry family members from post to post. For us, it is totally worth the cost and shows our dedication to the welfare of our pets. Obviously, if we invest so much time and money into our pets, we also are keeping them in good health. We make every effort to ensure that our dogs are healthy and would not spend so much time and money if we weren't concerned with their physical and medical state and we seek out the best veterinary care. \n\nI understand that some overseas breeders or rescue organizations may not have the same level of care for the animals that they attempt to import, but why should government service personnel be punished for the shortcomings of those groups? Please, for the sake of our military and State Department families, consider including an exception or exemption for government employees so that we can keep our families intact. We've already sacrificed so much for our nation, please don't deny us our pets! \n\nThank you for your consideration, \nSabrina Volciak\nForeign Service Spouse, mother of 5, and puppy parent of Harlee & Olivia\nU.S.Embassy Seoul, Republic of South Korea\n",

         "Dear Colleagues:\n\nI would like to voice my opposition to the proposed change or at least to respectfully request an exception for the pets of employees of the United States Government posted abroad.\n\nI have been a member of the U.S. Foreign Service of the State Department for nearly two decades.  That service requires personal sacrifices on the part of the employee, but also places an even greater burden on family members including children.  In a lifestyle defined by change in service of country, our family pets are some of the only consistent elements that help anchor our children across many moves.  When we move back to the United States next year from China, we will have completed three years of service where we were subjected to draconian movement restrictions, highlighted by a two-month complete lockdown which prompted the U.S. government to evacuate my family back to the United States.  It took some time to find a new normal after my family was finally reunited after again being subjected to quarantine and extreme testing measures.  \n\nAs currently drafted, the regulations would mean that we would be potentially separated from our beloved 7 lb dog for an indefinite period of time.  China's own strict regulations require rabies vaccination early and the country employs an extensive monitoring program.  We would also be willing to subject our pet to additional testing to prove it posed no threat to the American public upon our return.\n\nI respectfully request that the CDC consider making exceptions for families like mine which are working to protect our country abroad and want to have our families intact upon our return home.\n\nRegards,\n\nDaniel K. Delk, Jr.",

         "Hi - \n\nI request that the CDC creates an exemption from this rule for the personal pets of United States Government Employees on assignment abroad returning to the United States on official travel orders.  The proposed rule creates an extraordinary burden on those employees who are assigned overseas in key national security positions as Foreign Service Officers, Military personnel, and civil servants for periods of two to five years with their families and often their family pets.  While the risk of rabies is certainly higher in many overseas locations and the CDC has noted an increased risk from rescue dogs and large pet shippers with creative paperwork, this is simply not the case for the much smaller group of US Personnel on official orders overseas with personal pets.  \n\nIn my case, I have a small dog that I adopted in Virginia five years ago.  Before departing for my overseas post in Pretoria, I was able to vaccinate her for rabies through my American vet.  I have now done a direct transfer from South Africa to Thailand after a three year tour, before which I obtained rabies boosters from a qualified vet using US approved vaccine.  I will be here for three years and then will bring my dog back to the states.  Even though there are highly qualified vets, approved vaccinations commercially available, I will be required under the new rules (as I will have an expired US vaccination and two overseas vaccinations) to provide extensive vaccination documents, two vet certificates, and a titter test.  Additionally, I have to only enter at certain ports of entry that do not align with my department travel regulations as approved points of entry (meaning that I am out of pocket for substantial costs as I am no longer eligible for GSA city pair fares if I do not follow approved routings), then I have to revaccinate my dog and face delays and out of pocket costs.\n\nSurely there is a way to review the small number of animals entering the United States from US Government personnel on official travel with personal pets (long standing family companions and not large batches of rescue dogs from unknown origin) and the look at the risk and devise a much simpler process and system that protects America from rabies risks but doesn't apply a massive one-size-fits-all solution completely disproportionate to the risk.\n\nHaving to deal with the new regulations will further burden my family with bureaucratic distractions while I am supposed to be focused on doing key national security work and ultimately will reduce my willingness to serve overseas.  Please make this easier and cheaper for those sacrificing for our country in so many other ways.",

         "As a diplomat serving the United States overseas, the restrictions imposed by the CDC for the importation of cats and dogs are onerous.  Members of the Department of State, Military, USAID, and other agencies take their pets with them to many countries - often for years.  Then cannot bring their pets back home.  Many people adopt pets overseas in countries that do not have access to titer tests or 3-year rabies vaccines.  \n\nI am serving in Africa, and at this time can only obtain a one-year rabies vaccine for my dog.  In order to bring my dog back to the US, I will have to wait until he is revaccinated this fall, then have the vet draw blood, ask the Health Unit at post to prepare the blood for testing, carry it with me to the US, before submitting to a CDC-approved clinic.  \n\nNow, the CDC wants me to have certification from TWO vets?  Why?  Do both vets have to vaccinate my dog?  Or does one watch while the other vaccinates the dog?  And if the CDC is demanding the dog be vaccinated upon arrival in the US, then why do I need certificates from two vets at all?\n\nCan the CDC produce a report that shows how many US Citizens traveling on a diplomatic passport brought a rabies-infected pet into the US in the past ten years?  If not, what is their reasoning for imposing such ridiculous requirements.  I have traveled with my dog from the US to Colombia, Cambodia, Brazil and Mali. There has never been a health problem. ",

Asking me as a Foreign Service officer to jump through expensive bureaucratic hoops to bring back my dog to the United States - only to have her exposed to rabies in her own backyard - is frankly pretty silly.  In addition, the expense of this program to the U.S. taxpayer for the very small chance a foreign vaxxed dog has rabies is abusive to the taxpayer, including me!  If you want, make the owners re-vax within 30 days of entry or something.  This program is going to cost millions in additional USG facilities, employees, form verification etc, not to mention the tens of thousands that will need to be spent my U.S. military and foreign service families returning home with their four-footed family members.

Getting our dog re-vaccinated for rabies and working with a local veterinarian familiar with the requirements to submit the titer sample to a CDC-certified lab and completing the paperwork required was time consuming and expensive.  I don't understand why USG government employees and military members must be subjected to these restrictions especially considering how difficult and stressful a change of station already is for family members and pets.  The thought that CDC may make these restrictions even more severe, requiring re-vaccination of a pet upon arrival, would be unconscionable.  Why subject USG family pets to this abuse?  Why isn't a titer sample from a CDC certified lab sufficient?  Please reconsider these requirements and allow USG employees and military members to be exempted.",

         "I am a member of the US Department of State Senior Foreign Service, currently serving as an Ambassador in a Middle Eastern country. I urge CDC to extend a waiver or exemption to this policy for United States government personnel assigned outside the USA. We serve abroad to promote and protect the United States, at the pleasure of the President and Secretary of State. We do not choose where we go but rather go where we are directed. Exactly the same as members of the United States military. To maintain a modicum of normality, many of us - including me - bring our pet dogs with us when assigned abroad. The presence of our dogs benefits the employees and their families, especially children, helping them to cope with huge pressures and stressors stemming from life away from friends and families. Creating expensive, timely, and highly burdensome rules regarding importing, or reimporting, dogs to the US serves as a disincentive to public service and being assigned abroad. We may find a direct negative impact on retention of our personnel. Most importantly, families are likely to be without their pets for significant periods of time – when the pets are needed most. Your proposed rule penalizes proud and brave Americans serving their country. There is no reason for it. Extending a waiver or exemption to US government employees serving their country abroad is logical, humane, and will not increase the risk of rabies in the United States, as long as dogs are properly vaccinated and have a health certificate from a local vet. We're all on the same team - please support us!",

         "As a member of the U.S. Foreign Service currently posted to Africa, I strongly urge the CDC to reconsider this change in requirements.  Specifically, introducing a requirement for airlines to verify the proper documentation of dogs they would transport will further disincentivize airlines from being willing to transport dogs as accompanied baggage, a process that is significantly less expensive and less burdensome than transportation as cargo.  As things stand, a growing number of U.S. flag airlines will not transport dogs in hold; the proposed change would only make this harder.  The import restrictions introduced in 2019 led many airlines to refuse to transport dogs into the U.S. - which nearly led to our U.S.-vaccinated dog being left behind when our family was ordered to evacuate Ethiopia in 2021.  The current requirements for re-importing our family pets into the U.S. are stringent, but can be managed.  \n\nPlease do not make it any more difficult for Foreign Service and other families serving abroad to bring our dogs home.  They are members of our families and their presence in posts around the world adds immeasurably to the morale of U.S. government employees and our families stationed overseas.  We were stationed in Egypt in 2019 when the current import restrictions were introduced, and it added thousands of dollars of non-reimbursable expense to the cost of bringing our fully vaccinated dog back to the U.S. with us; ultimately, though, we were able to bring our dog home.  When we tried to bring the same dog home from Ethiopia in 2021, Turkish Airlines refused to transport him or any other dogs out of Addis Ababa if the final destination was the U.S., because of concerns about the rabies import restrictions.  We can work within the documentation requirements; a change to the restrictions for airlines, however, would close many flight options to bring our pets home with us.  Please do not do this.\n\n-Ruth A. Stevens-Klitz, U.S. Embassy Dakar, Senegal",

I am writing to urge that the CDC recommendations not become permanent. As part of my job requirements, I move every 1-4 years, making it very difficult to comply with the regulation of US Vaccination. For example, I have very clear records in ES, and my dog is vaccinated with US grade rabies vaccinations yearly. Creating additional steps to bring her home for the 2 months I have between tours puts undue stress on her, and my family as we leave our countries of residence.  There are better ways to ensure rabies vaccine compliance.  The incidence of rabies cases in ES is very low, not high, as the CDC website indicates.  I think better information and a nuanced approach would benefit all pet owners.  Perhaps the CDC could also make an exception for USG employees working overseas.  ",

         "Dear CDC Officials,\n\nMy two dogs are integral parts of my family, and have been for the past 10 years. \n\nAs a diplomat, I have served multiple tours in challenging places on behalf of my country, and my dogs have always gone with me.  \n\nAs the current Charge d'Affaires in Burundi, my husband and I already faced considerable hurdles getting our two dogs here.  We will be returning with them in May of 2024 to take up an assignment in Washington.  The proposed rules for returning pets to the United States puts an onerous burden upon those who are serving our nation overseas in tough places.  \n\nAs a diplomat in a country with a history of cyclical violence, I know about managing risks.  I respect that the intent of CDC is to prevent dangerous infections from reaching the U.S.  But making the requirements unnecessarily onerous does not manage risk as much as prevent people like me from taking tough assignments.\n\nWe keep our dogs healthy and current in all their vaccinations not because the CDC says to, but because we love our dogs.  I urge the CDC to consider the unique situations of U.S. diplomats and other serving the nation overseas as your consider these rules.  \n\nYou cannot eliminate risk, but you can manage it in ways that doesn't penalize those of us working overseas in service to our country.  \n\nSincerely,\nKeith R.

         "I think it is ironic that the “Commenter’s Checklist” admonishes the public to base its arguments against this outrageous CDC overreach on science and reason. The CDC has no cogent scientific, statistical, or rational basis for its proposed rule. As the poster child for incompetent bureaucracy, it seeks to solve problems that don’t exist and create expensive, redundant, irrelevant process requirements. Three rabid dogs over a period of seven years does not justify this lunacy or the designation of 119 countries as high-risk. Fraud on the part of a foreign animal rescues does not justify so substantially burdening private citizens and especially U.S. government officials abroad who seek to return home with their family pets. \n\nThe CDC wants to keep the USA free of DMRVV — great, that’s a goal we can all support. But the proposed rules go far beyond what is necessary for the USA — and what has been demonstrated necessary for ANY OTHER RABIES FREE COUNTRY — to keep rabies out. Microchip and vaccination certificate and/or microchip and titer can all be justified. Everything else creates a pointless bureaucratic hell for literally every stakeholder involved, including “partner” U.S. government agencies. \n\nUSDA endorsement of a vaccine certificate issued by a U.S. licensed veterinarian is nonsensical. Creating a new form to add to the pile is ridiculous. The “reasoning” provided for the proposed rule says nothing of systemic or even occasional problems with fraud related to U.S. issued vaccine certificates or the existing CDC form that doesn’t require endorsement. So why is the CDC proposing to waste everyone’s time and resources — including the taxpayer — to solve a nonexistent problem? The CDC doesn’t have a good reason. It’s that simple. \n\nThe CDC instituted draconian restrictions with little to no justification in the first place, blamed the pandemic, then extended its “temporary ban” year after year, has documented zero cases of imported dog rabies since, and — despite the current restrictions being demonstrably more than sufficient — somehow has decided to impose FURTHER restrictions to dog importation PERMANENTLY. If the CDC were an individual, it would be diagnosed with paranoia and panic disorder. The public shouldn’t be constantly punished by the CDC’s inability to apply logic and science to the real world. You can’t contract HIV by shaking hands with someone, and you don’t need this amount of red tape to keep the USA DMRVV-free. \n\nThe proposed rule states that animals from “high risk countries” that comply with all the requirements, including titer from an approved lab and vaccine certificate endorsed by the exporting country’s government vet, still have to be re-vaccinated upon arrival at port of entry. What is the point of requiring endorsement of documents if you’re just going to treat them as invalid anyway and re-vaccinate the animals? Logically, if foreign vaccine certificates aren’t going to be considered valid, regardless of endorsements or any other authentications, then there is no point whatsoever in requiring people to supply them for review by CDC/USDA/CBP. The odds of an animal with an acceptable titer result carrying rabies is roughly zero. If foreign vaccinations are so unacceptable, then just disregard them, require the titer, and re-vaccinate on arrival. Otherwise, accept the rabies certificate and titer and stop wasting everyone’s time re-vaccinating already vaccinated dogs at POE. \n\nOkay. Let’s deal with the import permit for a moment. What purpose does it actually serve? What due diligence is done on these permits (especially that justifies the months it takes to process them)? If the CDC were actually verifying U.S.-issued rabies certificates in advance to streamline arrival procedures, then it would make sense. But as it stands, it’s just another pointless hoop that CDC wastes time/money/staff holding and people traveling with their dogs waste time/money/stress jumping through. The proposed rule explains no actual purpose for the import permit nor is there any evidence offered that it has made one bit of difference to preventing rabies than vaccination certificates and titers provide on their own. \n\nCompared with simple processes and documentation required by the rest of the rabies-free word, this pile of red tape proposed by the CDC does not further reduce the risk of importation of rabies in any meaningful way. What it does is create a self-licking CDC ice cream cone. What it does is impose unacceptable burdens on U.S. government personnel serving their country in positions of strategic importance. What it does is unduly burden the CDC’s so-called “implementing partners” (do they really have a choice?), the USDA and CBP. What it does is cost the taxpayer millions that completely dwarf the supposed $400,000 post-exposure prophylaxis cost that is being used to justify these insane regulations.",

         "I'm aware of the extremely legitimate concerns regarding imported unknown, foreign dogs whose health & medical history is as unknown as the origins of the dog itself, however, to apply a blanket regulation on the age of puppies coming into the United States is an undue burden pressed upon small, ethical breeders who are working hard to better the breeding populations of dogs within the US, particularly those of us in rarer breeds. Puppies, being imported to the US, one or two puppies at a time, who themselves have been raised with care in the homes of small breeders abroad are not the same situation as unknown, \"puppy mill\" and \"rescued\" street dogs/pariah dogs found internationally. Although the risk of disease through these unknown dogs is legitimate, it is entirely a separate circumstance from individual dogs whose health and pedigree are known to both the exporting party and the importing party. These new rules, if passed as they are, will require Americans looking to import dogs into their breeding program to pay the exporter for an additional three to four months of care for the puppy, miss out on valuable training and bonding time with the dog, and place those burdens on the exporting family. In turn, depending on the size of the dog, the importing process under the belly of the plane places undue stress on a still-young animal. That is, of course, if the exporting party lets the dog leave their country of origin at all: six months raising & loving & training a dog only to send them thousands of miles away is a tall ask, nevermind the burden of raising the dog for that long, when the dog could simply be sold domestically. All of these concerns, human though they may be, are just the immediate concerns that come to mind when faced with this potential reality. Long-term, in rare and emerging breeds within the United States (those breeds participating in AKC's Foundation Stock Service & Misc. Class, as well as rarer breeds who have full recognition), we will see a depletion of quality & the lack of access to \"new lines\" will prevent the population from safely growing within the US. The risks of freezing & collecting semen and importing are significant, as there is never a guarantee of pregnancy, and often the best decision we may make for our smaller breeding programs is the import of a puppy, and place our hopes on that dog's health and conformation maturing into what we hope for. There simply must be a way to establish a international health certificate in Europe based on the parents known vaccine status, the presence of disease within a country, and further the health assessment on the young dog(s) in question-- that will decrease the risk of disease, increase the standard that imported, rescued dogs are held to, and allow dogs to enter into this country without the importing party missing out on critical socialization time with their young dogs. These dogs may be bred, eventually, following breed specific health testing, but they are all ultimately pets who are quite loved, and these rules stand to benefit very few, if any, people or animals in particular and likely will have lasting negative implications on both rescue dog populations and those importing known, well-bred dogs of good pedigree & health",

         "I am writing as an USG employee.  My family and I have been serving our country, primarily overseas, for the last 20 years, and have lived in seven different countries during that time. We rescued a couple kittens, while serving at our first overseas post.  While those sweet kitties died, we have since rescued a dog and a cat.  All of our pets have become beloved and important members of our family through our entire career.  With the many transitions we experience, having pets makes the biggest difference for our children's emotional well beings through these transfers.  \n\n\n Because we love our animals dearly, we have been diligent and meticulous about ensuring that they are always current on ALL of their vaccinations and see that they have have regular health care screenings. Over the years, we have come to know many, many other American families serving overseas, whether with the Department of State, the U.S. Armed Forces, or another government agency, and have observed nothing less than the same level of commitment toward ensuring that their pets are always well cared for and current on their vaccinations.\n\nAnyone who has moved overseas with a beloved pet knows all too well the many metaphorical hoops we already need to jump through, which are extremely time intensive and costly, in order to ensure that we have the appropriate health care certifications and documentation in order to enter the countries to which we travel and also back to the U.S. upon our return. I fully support ensuring that our animals are protected against rabies and providing documentation to demonstrate that; however, the additional restrictions imposed upon government personnel and their families in order to move their pets back to the U.S. from the high-risk rabies countries add untold hardship and stress during the already very stressful process of relocating from a foreign country. I have personally witnessed many families scramble - even with advanced planning and preparation - to complete all of the currently necessary steps to ensure that they can re-enter the U.S. with their dogs, adding an additional layer of stress and anxiety to their PCS (permanent change of station) moves.\n\nPersonally, my family very narrowly missed having to figure out how to bring our dog safely home from Ethiopia in 2021, when we had to evacuate due to civil unrest.   We were given only a day or two to pack up our belongings and complete all of the necessary steps required for a transition back to the U.S. from a diplomatic mission. Had the CDC’s dog importation suspension been in place at the time that we had to leave, we would have faced an impossible situation and the very real and heartbreaking prospect of having to leave our beloved pets behind. The thought of this makes me sick to my stomach... especially considering that we had just served nearly three years in a hostile country during the worst of the Covid pandemic. On many days, it was the comfort of our pets that got us through those challenging times.\nI respectfully ask that the CDC please consider very carefully the many negative effects that these proposed regulations will have on tens of thousands of government  personnel and their families who are serving the country overseas. While yes, we have chosen our careers and lifestyles of constant relocation, this does not mean that it is easy. We serve our country proudly and our pets provide an indescribable level of comfort and support while we are away from our families and friends back home. If these new regulations absolutely must go into effect, I propose an exemption for government personnel serving overseas in countries that are considered high risk for rabies. As mentioned above, I can understand and support requiring us to provide documentation of rabies vaccination, as has always been the case, but to add all of the additional layers of red tape in order simply to bring our furry family members home from the often challenging locations where we are serving on behalf the U.S. causes an enormous amount of stress and hardship during the already very difficult process of relocating internationally.\nThank you for your time and consideration.",

         "I urge decision-makers not to support the proposed HHS rule regarding the importation of dogs and cats without significant modifications/exemptions for U.S. servicemembers and U.S. public servants stationed overseas on behalf of the U.S. government.  This rule imposes undue difficulties on servicemembers and public servants, such as Department of State Foreign Service personnel, who are already assuming tremendous security, financial, and personal hardships to move their families abroad in support of U.S. national interests.  The HHS rule appears to be focused on “incomplete or fraudulent rabies vaccination certificates” and “criminal networks involved in the lucrative dog trade”.  Neither of these categories apply to public servants and military members.  These U.S. citizens understand the importance of full compliance with U.S. rules and regulations, particularly as they impact public health in the United States.  The majority of the dogs and cats traveling with these U.S. citizens were born in the United States and cared for by U.S. vets.  Those adopted by families overseas receive extensive treatment by foreign vets, in compliance with U.S. best practices for animal care.  By imposing such harsh restrictions on U.S. public servants and military personnel, the CDC is discounting the trust that the U.S. government already places in such personnel to best represent the interests of the United States, including the duty to keep the U.S. homeland safe from public health threats.  It is the height of irony that the U.S. government would spend hundreds of thousands of dollars vetting military servicemembers and public servants for high security clearances, only to turn around and say that they cannot be trusted to ensure their pets are properly vaccinated.  By forcing U.S. servicemembers and public servants to follow the proposed rules, HHS will be forcing these families to incur significant financial hardships and additional stress in altering travel arrangements under the guise of addressing a threat that simply does not exist among this demographic of traveler.  Families who cannot afford to shoulder this burden will be faced with the unthinkable decision of having to re-home pets that have become members of their family.  If we are asking servicemembers and public servants to assume risks by taking hardships assignments outside the United States, we must trust them to comply with existing U.S. regulations.  If this act is to go forward, it simply must have an exemption built in for personnel overseas on official U.S. government orders.\n\nThank you.",

         "I am a US government employee and a public health veterinary serving my country abroad with my family and my dog. I appreciate the opportunity to comment on CDC’s proposed rulemaking regarding the import of dogs and cats into the United States. The impetus of this law resulted from numerous cases of fraudulent import paperwork and the importation of dogs with rabies. The intent of this law is to prevent additional occurrences and protect public health by preventing the reintroduction and spread of dog-maintained rabies virus variant (DMRVV) in the United States. I understand the intent of the law and the concern for public health however I ask the CDC to consider and mitigate the unintended consequences of this proposed rule. As it stands, this proposed rule is detrimental to US government employees serving their country abroad who navigate the complicated animal health requirements of many countries as they move their companion animals with them. \n\nAs I read the executive summary of the rule, I see ‘importation’ again and again. The CDC needs to better define what conditions they are considering when they are  talking about ‘importation’ and what activity they are trying to regulate. When US government personnel return to the US after being posted abroad, we are not ‘importing’ our dogs or cats. We are returning to the US with our family and our pets generally for a short period of time before we are sent to our next post. During this time, we seek the medical care we could not receive overseas, we attend to the needs of family that remained in the US, we take care of personnel and financial matters, and we receive training to prepare us for our next post. Categorizing our pets as imports, requiring them to enter only through certain ports, and mandating a quarantine period puts an undue burden on a group of public servants who already get enough of that with these emotionally, mentally, and physically demanding careers we have chosen for the public good. \nWe follow the rules of animal transport, vaccination, and animal health all because we want the best for our pets and we want them to be able to move with us and will not risk their loss. We pose little threat to the DMRVV-free status of the US and are unlikely to be associated with fraudulent paperwork. I ask that the CDC grant an exception to the requirements in this proposed rule, either through the definition of import, acknowledgement of government and military personnel in the rule, or in some other manner. Moving away from a country of origin focused rule to an end use focused rule (sale/adoption versus companion animal) should also be considered. \n\nI understand that the CDC makes decisions in the interest of protecting public health and hope the CDC works to understand the situation of US government personnel and their companion animals, and reconsiders the extent and applicability of the proposed rule and makes an exception for US Government personnel. The CDC is basically exiling me from returning to the US until my dogs dies, so thanks for that. \nHHS/CDC also proposes to prohibit or otherwise restrict importation of dogs into the United States from certain countries that have a history of exporting dogs infected with DMRVV to other countries or have demonstrated a lack of appropriate veterinary controls to prevent the exportation of rabid dogs: An exception for US government personnel should be added here. We have no control over where we are posted and should not pay the price because we are serving our country abroad with our family which incudes our companion animals. It also doesn’t help that CDC has designated most countries as DMRVV high risk countries. \nPrior to traveling out of the United States, a USDA-Accredited Veterinarian would need to complete and sign a form titled “ Certification of U.S.-issued Rabies Vaccination for Live Dog Re-entry into the United States.” - Does this form exist – have you coordinated with USDA VS to create this form? What is your educational campaign to provide it to all of the accredited vets and make sure vet clinics know they need this? Also, what are you going to do for people like me who are already overseas? What if I don’t return for 5 more years? You are complicating an already complicating process by requiring yet another form. And expecting people to hold on to the form for the 2-4 years they are at post. Or even longer if we don’t come home between posts. \nRegarding quarantine facilities -  I do not see the CDC having staff to coordinate this quarantine process and how will it be funded? This seems like tax payers will pay the burden. \n",

In addition to duplicative requirements which seem to serve little purpose (for example, verification of the vaccination by titer test and re-vaccination even once the first vaccination has been verified) the lack of flexibility with which it has been implemented is remarkable.  The CDC has shown inflexibility at every step of the way, refusing to make things simpler for military and foreign service members who own pets and also not following the letter of their own rules.  Last time I returned to the US with a dog, I received an authorization which stated it was valid at any of the approved ports of entry.  Yet, when I had to change to another additional port of entry, this created problems on re-entry, even though the CDC permit specifically stated this was authorized.  This rigid and inflexible approach does not help protect the US from rabies and does a huge disservice to those serving our country overseas.",

She spent 2 years of her life living in an outdoor kennel exposed to the elements with 3,000 other dogs. No one even gave her a glance because she is not a pure bred dog. A wonderful rescue brought her to us and she has become a wonderful addition to our family. There are so many other dogs like her who could find loving homes in the United States.

         "As an advocate for animal rights and someone who wishes to be a voice for those that do not have one, I am writing to oppose the proposed ruling, “Control of Communicable Disease; Foreign Quarantine: Importation of Dogs and Cats.” \n \nRabies control is crucial, but tightening the rules on dog importation is the way to achieve this goal. Rabies is extremely rare in domestic cases, therefore it is an issue with the wild animal population. It does not make sense to punish rescue organizations for something out of their control. This is a half-baked measure that will have insignificant benefits and will cause suffering to innocent animals.\n \nNon-profit organizations in the United States and individuals go to extraordinary lengths to rescue dogs from wars and climate disasters around the world. We should continue to make it safe and feasible. \n\nIn 2020 dogs accounted for just 1% (36) of all rabies cases in the US. In the past eight years, there have only been 4 cases of rabies from imported dogs. \n \nThe new proposed laws are unclear and an overstep. They burden nonprofit rescue organizations and private individuals with extreme costs and requirements that are nearly impossible to achieve for those working in war-torn countries like Ukraine. \n \nI strongly ask the agency to reconsider these proposed measures and refocus their efforts on rabies prevention to wildlife and livestock where regulations are truly needed to stop the disease in the United States.

I don’t see why harsher restrictions need to be placed on rescues/individuals that are doing their due diligence to safely and humanely bring these animals to the US. My dog came from Russia and she’s lovely. Kind of crazy, but that’s a result of her breed rather than any disease. She arrived in the US fully vetted and my local vet did a full work up on her at her first appointment. These dogs don’t represent a problem to the level that these restrictions cover. The restrictions will result in the deaths of a lot of animals that could have found caring homes there. Please reconsider this. I know it’s not the most pressing issue that you’ll all deal with, but my dog provided an incredible amount of comfort and was integral to my mental health.

Homeless dogs, outside the U.S., run the risk of being denied a happy and loving home and life. All animals deserve the chance for a happy life. The homeless dog population in other countries could decline if they are allowed in the States. Other countries and people do not always treat animals with the same love and caring as we do here. Animals entering the U.S. are required to have a valid rabies certificate. Changing policy will cause an undue hardship on people and the homeless dogs.

Our family joined the Foreign Service without pets, and waited several years and carefully weighed our options before we decided that we were comfortable with getting a pet. We now have two dogs and they are very much a part of our family. Over the years we’ve experienced increased costs and bureaucratic hurdles to traveling with our dogs, but we are dedicated to keeping them as they are truly family members. They have grown up with our children and provide unparalleled companionship and comfort during our numerous transitions between posts. With so many countries involved with this ban, the posts we are comfortable bidding on have drastically decreased. We want to serve overseas in a variety of countries and cultures as part of the Foreign Service, but we need to be confident that our furry family members will be able to arrive and depart with us. Leaving them behind is simply not an option. We are federal government employees and we provide high quality care for our dogs and abide by the rules.

         "I’m an animal lover and am writing today to oppose the proposed ruling, “Control of Communicable Disease; Foreign Quarantine: Importation of Dogs and Cats.” \n \nI support the CDC’s intention to protect the United States against additional rabies cases, however I do not agree that hardening the rules on dog importation is the way to achieve this goal. According to the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases there are approximately 5,000 confirmed cases of rabies in animals in the United States and the vast majority are found in wildlife. Why harden the rules on dog importation, especially for responsible non-profits and individuals? \n \nNon-profit organizations in the United States and individuals go to extraordinary lengths to rescue dogs from wars and climate disasters around the world. We should not close our doors to this work but instead continue to make it safe and feasible for it to continue. In 2020 dogs accounted for just 1% (36) of all rabies cases in the US. In the past eight years, there have only been 4 cases of rabies from imported dogs. \n \nThe new proposed laws are unclear and an overstep. They burden nonprofit rescue organizations and private individuals with extreme costs and requirements that are nearly impossible to achieve for those working in war-torn countries like Ukraine. \n \nI strongly ask the agency to reconsider these proposed measures and refocus their efforts on rabies prevention to wildlife and livestock where regulations are truly needed to stop the disease in the United States.",

Many homeless dogs who could otherwise have found new homes in the U.S. will suffer and die as a result of these new requirements. People living abroad, who may be serving or working for the government, may be forced to leave their beloved animal companions behind. Please use fair, clear, brief rules that keep the U.S. safe from rabies without causing innocent, healthy animals to die for lack of homes.\nTHANK YOU.",

         "I OPPOSE the proposed ruling, “Control of Communicable Disease; Foreign Quarantine: Importation of Dogs and Cats.” \n \nI support the CDC’s intention to protect the United States against additional rabies cases, however I do not agree that hardening the rules on dog importation is the way to achieve this goal. According to the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases there are approximately 5,000 confirmed cases of rabies in animals in the United States and the vast majority are found in wildlife. Why harden the rules on dog importation, especially for responsible non-profits and individuals? \n \nNon-profit organizations in the United States and individuals go to extraordinary lengths to rescue dogs from wars and climate disasters around the world. We should not close our doors to this work but instead continue to make it safe and feasible for it to continue. In 2020 dogs accounted for just 1% (36) of all rabies cases in the US. In the past eight years, there have only been 4 cases of rabies from imported dogs. \n \nThe new proposed laws are unclear and an overstep. They burden nonprofit rescue organizations and private individuals with extreme costs and requirements that are nearly impossible to achieve for those working in war-torn countries like Ukraine. \n \nI strongly ask the agency to reconsider these proposed measures and refocus their efforts on rabies prevention to wildlife and livestock where regulations are truly needed to stop the disease in the United States. \n",

    "In this notebook, we will convert the EPA NaKnowBase into RDF format. The NaKnowBase is a standard relational database, composed of multiple tables. We will add each table to the graph independently, thereby reducing semantic overlap errors. This process will include both automated and manual curation of URIs for the data. This notebook should be treated as a toolkit: use the examples within and you'll be able to match the process to your own data.\n",

While most inconsistencies in terminology that resulted from this are minor, one may cause slight confusion.

    "#### Be Aware of Hidden Files\n",
    "Take special caution with your data folder. Some operating systems will add hidden files without informing you and this can cause errors to occur. Specifically, Mac users have reported errors due to the creation of the .DS_Store hidden file, which saves the layout of a folder so it looks the same when you come back to it. Often, these files will reveal that they exist during the first five code blocks below. If you get the error **NTriples parsing error (or unrecognized file format) in fileYouDidn'tKnowAbout**, you likely have a hidden file that the Ontosearcher program is attempting (and failing) to read. Read up on the file, verify it is safe to delete, and then do so. \n",
    "\n",
    "To see hidden files:\n",
    "* On Windows, open the folder, go to View, and click the checkbox for *Hidden Files*.\n",
    "* On a Mac, press Command + Shift + Period. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Python and Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "The Ontosearcher code was written in Python. These training documents were made in Jupyter Notebook, a tool for making interactive Python documents. While you were given .html copies of both documents for ease of access, it is necessary that you have Python installed to actually use the code, and strongly recommended that you also get Jupyter Notebook, since it will allow you to more easily mirror the processes seen here and also allows you to see the results of each block of code individually. Depending on your organization's security policies, you may need to contact your organization's IT staff to install one or both, and any dependencies. \n",
    "\n",
    "The process:\n",
    "1. Install Python on your machine.\n",
    "2. Install Jupyter Notebook on your machine\n",
    "3. Test run the block full of imports below. If you get a ModuleNotFound error, open a terminal window and use the command *pip install moduleNameHere* to install it. Repeat until no more errors occur. Warnings are typically fine.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Working In Multiple Sessions\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks continue to show the output of a block of code, even if you shut down your computer and relaunch the notebook later. **This does NOT mean your work is how you left it.** When the notebook shuts down, all of the variables in the code you've ran so far are lost. You need to re-run every block of code every time you come back to the notebook to work more. You could do this by hitting run on every block of code in order, but there are easier ways. Under the *Kernel* menu up top, select *Restart and Run All*. Or, click the last cell, then click the *Cell* menu at the top and select \"Run All Above\"."

These 7 columns all share an implicit fact: they describe the Outer Diameter.\n",

    "You can check ontologies and easily find results for \"Unit\" or \"Method\", but you aren't likely to find one for \"Outer Diameter Unit\" or \"Outer Diameter Method\". It makes more sense, and it makes things easier, if we separate the implicit fact out of the columns. In these cases, we use **Nodebags**. First, we find a match for the shared theme of the columns. Outer Diameter easily matches to http://ncicb.nci.nih.gov/xml/owl/EVS/Thesaurus.owl#C124136 (\"Outer Diameter\"). Then, we match each of the simplified columns: instead of finding \"Outer Diameter Unit\" somewhere, we find \"Unit\" and make the match, and repeat for the other 6. Then, we feed the overarching term, the lesser terms, and the graph into the nodebag method defined below. It will perform the same replacements as the simple version above, but while maintaining this implied thematic grouping in the RDF. "

Then, once all of the bags were made, it would attempt to populate them. This worked fine in many cases, but caused issues if a single row needed multiple bags. Now, nodebag makes a single bag and fills it before moving on to the next.

When we convert these column names into ontology terms, naturally, they resolve to the same thing: SDAvg and SDAvg2 both match to C37917 - 'average'. If all 12 of these datapoints were put in the same bag, it would be impossible to tell which 6 went together. To keep things clear, we instead put each set in their own bag. \n",

    "However, this solution adds an additional problem. There are three columns that apply to **both** sets: SDType, SDModality, and SDMethod. As explained previously, we can't leave something like \"Size Distribution Method\" outside of a bag because it is a combination of the overarching \"Size Distribution\" and the actual information of \"Method\". But, which bag do we put it in? It applies to the data in both bags, so an immediate response might be \"both\", but this has issues - first, we have to keep track of which bags this data needs inserted in until we reach the point of insertion, and second, it duplicates the data. Instead, we take the opposite approach: we put the data that applies to both bags into its own Size Distribution bag that only holds metadata. "

In the Outer Diameter example, there is no chance for the term Outer Diameter to have been matched already because it does not exist alone as a column heading; it only exists in combination with other words. Because of this, it is safe to use Outer Diameter as the term for the bags. If the overarching term for a set of columns is ALSO a column itself and could have been matched automatically by the matcher() method, use iri_nodebag. For instance, the NKB has the columns:\n",

    "NEW TO V2 - There is a risk, when mapping terms, that you may cause an accidental collision. When we change a mapping, we find the triple we want to change, add a version of it with the change made, and then delete the original. Graphs can't hold duplicate triples. If you try to add a triple that is already in the graph, nothing happens. If you continue and delete the original, you've lost data! Let's look at an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you have a graph with two triples in it. <br>\n",
    "Graph: { (s, p, o), (s, p, r) }.<br>\n",
    "Let's say that you decide the term r is wrong, and you'd rather use o.<br>\n",
    "You run a search for any triples using r and it returns (s, p, r).<br>\n",
    "To make the change, you add a version of that triple with the desired change made: (s, p, o)<br>\n",
    "Graph: { (s, p, o), (s, p, r) }. Note that nothing was actually added since (s, p, o) was already in the graph.<br>\n",
    "Now, to finish the \"change\", you remove the unmodified version: (s, p, r). <br>\n",
    "Graph: { (s, p, o) }.<br>\n",
    "Instead of modifying something, all you actually did was delete it!\n",
    "\n",
    "Protecting against this is simple. We add an \"if\" statement. If the modified version of the triple is already in the graph, don't add or delete anything! Simply print out a warning to the curator that something seems suspicious. It is very unlikely you will have two terms that really do map to the same thing in such a way as to cause duplicate triples, so whenever it occurs, it's a good sign that something was mismapped. "
